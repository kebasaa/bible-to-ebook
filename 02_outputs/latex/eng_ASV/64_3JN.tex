\nonumchapter{3 John}



\bibchap{1}\bibverse{1}The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.  \bibverse{2}Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth. \bibverse{3}For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth. \bibverse{4}Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.  \bibverse{5}Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal; \bibverse{6}who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God: \bibverse{7}because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles. \bibverse{8}We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers for the truth.  \bibverse{9}I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not. \bibverse{10}Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth and casteth them out of the church. \bibverse{11}Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God. \bibverse{12}Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true.  \bibverse{13}I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen: \bibverse{14}but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.
