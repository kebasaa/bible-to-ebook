\nonumchapter{Philemon}



\bibchap{1}\bibverse{1}Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker, \bibverse{2}and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house: \bibverse{3}Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  \bibverse{4}I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers, \bibverse{5}hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints; \bibverse{6}that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ. \bibverse{7}For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.  \bibverse{8}Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting, \bibverse{9}yet for love’s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus: \bibverse{10}I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, \bibverse{11}who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me: \bibverse{12}whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart: \bibverse{13}whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel: \bibverse{14}but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will. \bibverse{15}For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever; \bibverse{16}no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord. \bibverse{17}If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself. \bibverse{18}But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account; \bibverse{19}I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides. \bibverse{20}Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.  \bibverse{21}Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say. \bibverse{22}But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.  \bibverse{23}Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee; \bibverse{24}and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.  \bibverse{25}The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
