  \begin{itemize}
    \item Joshua
    \item Judges
    \item Samuel
    \item Kings
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{The Latter Prophets}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Isaiah
    \item Jeremiah
    \item Ezekiel
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{The Twelve Minor Prophets.} These are considered one book:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hosea
    \item Joel
    \item Amos
    \item Obadiah
    \item Jonah
    \item Micah

\part{The Writings}

The Ketuvim (``Writings'') is the third and final section of the Tanakh, after the Torah and the Prophets.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{The Sifrei Emet:} In Masoretic manuscripts (and some printed editions), Psalms, Proverbs and Job are presented in a special two-column form emphasizing the parallel stichs in the verses, which are a function of their poetry. Collectively, these three books are known as Sifrei Emet (``Books of truth'' -- an acronym of the titles of the three books in Hebrew that yields ``Emet'', i.e. ``truth''). These three books (except for the beginning and end of Job) are also the only ones in the Hebrew Bible with a special system of cantillation notes that are designed to emphasize parallel stichs within verses.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Psalms
    \item Book of Proverbs
    \item Book of Job
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{The Five Megillot:} The five relatively short books of Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Book of Esther are collectively known as the Five Megillot (``Five Scrolls''), and are typically read in synagoges on the holidays, as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Song of Songs (Pesach -- Passover)
    \item Ruth (Shavuot -- Pentecost)
    \item Lamentations (Yom Kippur -- Day of Atonement)
    \item Ecclesiastes (Sukkot -- Feast of Tabernacles)
    \item Book of Esther (Purim -- Feast of Lots)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Other books:} The remaining books in the ``Writings'' are the Book of Daniel, Ezra–Nehemiah and the Books of Chronicles. These books describe relatively late events and in parts contain significant portions in Biblical Aramaic.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Daniel
    \item Ezra-Nehemiah
    \item Chronicles
  \end{itemize}
