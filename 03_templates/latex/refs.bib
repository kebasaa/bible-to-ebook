However, multiple interpretations of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{p}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} exist, which reflect a diverse range of methods to calculate it. A comparison of the performance of these methods against field observations in different global ecosystems is urgently needed. In this study, potential evaporation was defined as the rate of terrestrial evaporation (or \textit{evapotranspiration}) that the actual ecosystem would attain if it were to evaporate at maximal rate for the given atmospheric conditions. We use eddy-covariance measurements from the FLUXNET2015 database, covering 11 different biomes, to parameterise and inter-compare the most widely used {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{p}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} methods and to uncover their relative performance. For each of the 107 sites, we isolate days for which ecosystems can be considered unstressed, based on both an energy balance and a soil water content approach. Evaporation measurements during these days are used as reference to calibrate and validate the different methods to estimate {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{p}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Our results indicate that a simple radiation-driven method, calibrated per biome, consistently performs best against in situ measurements (mean correlation of 0.93; unbiased RMSE of 0.56\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;day{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}; and bias of {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−0.02{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;day{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}). A Priestley and Taylor method, calibrated per biome, performed just slightly worse, yet substantially and consistently better than more complex Penman-based, Penman–Monteith-based or temperature-driven approaches. We show that the poor performance of Penman–Monteith-based approaches largely relates to the fact that the unstressed stomatal conductance cannot be assumed to be constant in time at the ecosystem scale. On the contrary, the biome-specific parameters required by simpler radiation-driven methods are relatively constant in time and per biome type. This makes these methods a robust way to estimate {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{p}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} and a suitable tool to investigate the impact of water use and demand, drought severity and biome productivity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {1 It has been proposed that in longer-living leaves the allocation of biomass to structural components is greater than in shorter-living leaves, leading to a greater leaf mass per area (LMA) and to lower assimilation rates. However, direct evidence in support of this hypothesis is very scarce. 2 In the present work we investigated the relationships between leaf duration and LMA, leaf thickness and fibre concentrations (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) in five oak species, five pine species and three additional tree species, differing in leaf life spans. Correlations among leaf life span and the other leaf traits were obtained both across species (TIPs) and as phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). 3 Leaf thickness and LMA increased steadily with leaf longevity. No relationship was found between leaf longevity and the lignin concentration per unit leaf mass. Evergreen leaves were found to have higher mean concentrations of cellulose and hemicellulose than deciduous ones. However, no relationship was observed between leaf longevity and the concentration of structural carbohydrates across the set of evergreen species, although PIC correlations revealed increases in cellulose with leaf longevity within particular lineages. 4 Our findings reveal that leaf reinforcement by structural carbohydrates depends on leaf habit (deciduous vs. evergreen) and, within a given lineage, also on leaf longevity. However, among the evergreen species co-occurring in a particular environment, leaf duration may apparently be increased, with no need for increases in the concentration of structural components per unit leaf mass.},

Surprisingly, experimental capabilities required to quantify the energy–transpiration coupling at the leaf scale are lacking, challenging our ability to test basic questions of importance for resolving large-scale processes. The present study describes an experimental set-up for the simultaneous observation of transpiration rates and all leaf energy balance components under controlled conditions, using an insulated closed loop miniature wind tunnel and artificial leaves with pre-defined and constant diffusive conductance for water vapour. A range of tests documents the above capabilities of the experimental set-up and points to potential improvements. The tests reveal a conceptual flaw in the assumption that leaf temperature can be characterized by a single value, suggesting that even for thin, planar leaves, a temperature gradient between the irradiated and shaded or transpiring and non-transpiring leaf side can lead to bias when using observed leaf temperatures and fluxes to deduce effective conductances to sensible heat or water vapour transfer. However, comparison of experimental results with an explicit leaf energy balance model revealed only minor effects on simulated leaf energy exchange rates by the neglect of cross-sectional leaf temperature gradients, lending experimental support to our current understanding of leaf gas and energy exchange processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Drought can cause tree mortality through hydraulic failure and carbon starvation. To prevent excess water loss, plants typically close their stomata before massive embolism formation occurs. However, unregulated water loss through leaf cuticles and bark continues after stomatal closure. Here, we studied the diurnal and seasonal dynamics of bark transpiration and how it is affected by tree water availability. We measured continuously for six months water loss and CO2 efflux from branch segments and needle-bearing shoots in Pinus halepensis growing in a control and an irrigation plot in a semi-arid forest in Israel. Our aim was to find out how much passive bark transpiration is affected by tree water status in comparison with shoot transpiration and bark CO2 emission that involve active plant processes, and what is the role of bark transpiration in total tree water use during dry summer conditions. Maximum daily water loss rate per bark area was 0.03–0.14 mmol m−2 s−1, which was typically {\textasciitilde}76\% of the shoot transpiration rate (on leaf area basis) but could even surpass the shoot transpiration rate during the highest evaporative demand in the control plot. Irrigation did not affect bark transpiration rate. Bark transpiration was estimated to account for 64–78\% of total water loss in drought-stressed trees, but only for 6–11\% of the irrigated trees, due to differences in stomatal control between the treatments. Water uptake through bark was observed during most nights, but it was not high enough to replenish the lost water during the day. Unlike bark transpiration, branch CO2 efflux decreased during drought due to decreased metabolic activity. Our results demonstrate that although bark transpiration represents a small fraction of the total water loss through transpiration from foliage in non-stressed trees, it may have a large impact during drought.},

	url = {https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-1169624/v1},
	abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a preeminent state variable that controls the energy and water exchange between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere. At the landscape-scale, LST is derived from thermal infrared radiance measured using space-borne radiometers. At the plot-scale, the flux tower recorded longwave radiation components are inverted to retrieve LST. Since the down-welling longwave component was not measured routinely until recently, usually only the up-welling longwave component is used for the plot-scale LST retrieval. However, we found that ignoring reflected down-welling longwave radiation for plot-scale LST estimations can lead to substantial error. This also has important implications for estimating the correct surface emissivity using flux tower measurements, which is needed for plot-scale LST retrievals. The present study proposes a new method for plot-scale emissivity and LST estimation and addresses in detail the consequences of omitting down-welling longwave radiation as frequently done in the literature. Our analysis uses ten eddy covariance sites with different land cover types and found that the LST values obtained using both up-welling and down-welling longwave radiation components are 0.5 to 1.5 K lower than estimates using only up-welling longwave radiation. Furthermore, the proposed method helps identify inconsistencies between plot-scale radiometric and aerodynamic measurements, likely due to footprint mismatch between measurement approaches. We also found that such inconsistencies can be removed by slight corrections to the up-welling longwave component and subsequent energy balance closure, resulting in realistic estimates of surface emissivity and consistent relationships between energy fluxes and surface-air temperature differences. Landscape-scale daytime LST obtained from satellite data (MODIS TERRA) was strongly correlated with our plot-scale estimates for most of the sites, but higher by several Kelvin at two sites. We also quantified the uncertainty in estimated LST and surface emissivity using the different methods and found that the proposed method does not result in increased uncertainty. The results of this work have significant implications for the combined use of aerodynamic and radiometric measurements to understand the interactions and feedbacks between LST and surface-atmosphere exchange processes.},

This study derives a new thermal imaging validation methodology via the use of a blackbody source (indoors) and real-world field conditions (outdoors). We have demonstrated this method with three popular LWIR cameras by DJI (Zenmuse XT-R, Zenmuse XT2 and, the M2EA) operated by three different popular DJI RPAS platforms (Matrice 600 Pro, M300 RTK and, the Mavic 2 Enterprise Advanced). Results from the blackbody work show that each camera has a highly linearized response (R2 \&gt; 0.99) in the temperature range 5–40 °C as well as a small (\&lt;2 °C) temperature bias that is less than the stated accuracy of the cameras. Field validation was accomplished by imaging vegetation and concrete targets (outdoors and at night), that were instrumented with surface temperature sensors. Environmental parameters (air temperature, humidity, pressure and, wind and gusting) were measured for several hours prior to imaging data collection and found to either not be a factor, or were constant, during the {\textasciitilde}30 min data collection period. In-field results from imagery at five heights between 10 m and 50 m show absolute temperature retrievals of the concrete and two vegetation sites were within the specifications of the cameras. The methodology has been developed with consideration of active RPAS operational requirements.},

The use of non-contact remote sensing methods such as thermal infrared measurements provides an ideal solution, but their accuracy has been low (in the order of 2°C) due to necessity for corrections for material emissivity and fluctuations in background radiation (Lbg). A novel ’dual-reference’ method was developed to increase the accuracy of infrared needle-leaf surface temperature measurements in the field. It accounts for variations in Lbg and corrects for the systematic camera offset using two reference plates. We accurately captured surface temperature and leaf-to-air temperature differences of needle-leaves in a forest ecosystem with large diurnal and seasonal temperature fluctuations with an uncertainty of ±0.23 and ±0.28°C, respectively. Routine high precision leaf temperature measurements even under harsh field conditions, such as demonstrated here, opens the way for investigating a wide range of leaf-scale processes and its dynamics.},

	abstract = {The drier climates predicted for many regions will result in reduced evaporative cooling, leading to leaf heat stress and enhanced mortality. The extent to which nonevaporative cooling can contribute to plant resilience under these increasingly stressful conditions is not well known at present. Using a novel, high accuracy infrared system for the continuous measurement of leaf temperature in mature trees under field conditions, we assessed leaf-to-air temperature differences (ΔTleaf–air) of pine needles during drought. On mid-summer days, ΔTleaf–air remained {\textless} 3°C, both in trees exposed to summer drought and in those provided with supplemental irrigation, which had a more than 10-fold higher transpiration rate. The nonevaporative cooling in the drought-exposed trees must be facilitated by low resistance to heat transfer, generating a large sensible heat flux, H. ΔTleaf–air was weakly related to variations in the radiation load and mean wind speed in the lower part of the canopy, but was dependent on canopy structure and within-canopy turbulence that enhanced the H. Nonevaporative cooling is demonstrated as an effective cooling mechanism in needle-leaf trees which can be a critical factor in forest resistance to drying climates. The generation of a large H at the leaf scale provides a basis for the development of the previously identified canopy-scale ‘convector effect’.},

Here, conditions promoting enhancement or suppression of fe with increasing U for a wide range of environmental conditions are explored numerically using leaf-level gas exchange theories that combine a stomatal conductance model based on optimal water use strategies (maximizing the ‘net’ carbon gain at a given fe), energy balance considerations, and biochemical demand for CO2. The analysis showed monotonic increases in fe with increasing U at low light levels. However, a decline in modeled fe with increasing U were predicted at high light levels but only in certain instances. The dominant mechanism explaining this decline in modeled fe with increasing U is a shift from evaporative cooling to surface heating at high light levels. New and published sap flow measurements for potted Pachira macrocarpa and Messerschmidia argentea plants conducted in a wind tunnel across a wide range of U (2−8m s−1) and two different soil moisture conditions were also employed to assess how fevaries with increasing U. The radiative forcing imposed in the wind tunnel was only restricted to the lower end of expected field conditions. At this low light regime, the findings from the wind tunnel experiments were consistent with the predicted trends.},

	abstract = {Heatwaves are likely to increase in frequency and intensity with climate change, which may impair tree function and forest C uptake. However, we have little information regarding the impact of extreme heatwaves on the physiological performance of large trees in the field. Here, we grew Eucalyptus parramattensis trees for 1 year with experimental warming (+3°C) in a field setting, until they were greater than 6 m tall. We withheld irrigation for 1 month to dry the surface soils and then implemented an extreme heatwave treatment of 4 consecutive days with air temperatures exceeding 43°C, while monitoring whole-canopy exchange of CO2 and H2O, leaf temperatures, leaf thermal tolerance, and leaf and branch hydraulic status. The heatwave reduced midday canopy photosynthesis to near zero but transpiration persisted, maintaining canopy cooling. A standard photosynthetic model was unable to capture the observed decoupling between photosynthesis and transpiration at high temperatures, suggesting that climate models may underestimate a moderating feedback of vegetation on heatwave intensity. The heatwave also triggered a rapid increase in leaf thermal tolerance, such that leaf temperatures observed during the heatwave were maintained within the thermal limits of leaf function. All responses were equivalent for trees with a prior history of ambient and warmed (+3°C) temperatures, indicating that climate warming conferred no added tolerance of heatwaves expected in the future. This coordinated physiological response utilizing latent cooling and adjustment of thermal thresholds has implications for tree tolerance of future climate extremes as well as model predictions of future heatwave intensity at landscape and global scales.},

	abstract = {An accurate simulation of the sensible heat flux (H) over vegetation from thermal remote sensing requires an a priori estimate of roughness length and the excess resistance parameter kB−1. Despite being the subject of considerable interest in hydrometeorology, there still does not exist a uniform method for estimating roughness length from remote sensing techniques. This study demonstrates a turbulent diffusion method to simulate canopy-air sensible heat. The performance of the roughness length scheme as described in Chen et al. (2013, https://doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-056.1) was examined by comparing simulated H to measured values at 28 flux tower stations, which include seven different land covers (needle forest, broadleaf forest, shrub, savanna, grassland, cropland, and sparsely vegetated land). The model predictions of H for grass, crop, and sparsely vegetated land compare favorably with observed values, when actual canopy height is given. H is significantly underestimated at forest sites due to a high value of kB−1. Among the different physical representations for the canopy, canopy-soil mixture, and soil component, it is found that such a high kB−1 value is caused by the high kB−1 value for the canopy part. The reasons for this high kB−1 were investigated from canopy-air physical process of turbulent diffusion. This study introduces the vertical foliage density information into a column canopy-air turbulent diffusion model to include the different momentum and heat transfer efficiencies in the vertical canopy layers to enhance the thermal turbulent transfer intensity above the tall canopy. The new model has been verified to provide accurate simulation over different canopy structures.},

	abstract = {To identify drought-tolerant crop cultivars or achieve a balance between water use and yield, accurate measurements of crop water stress are needed. In this study, the canopy temperature (Tc) of maize at the late vegetative stage was extracted from high-resolution red-green-blue (RGB, 1.25 cm) and thermal (7.8 cm) images taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). To reduce the number of parameters for crop water stress monitoring, four simple methods that require only Tc were identified: Tc, degrees above non-stress, standard deviation of Tc, and variation coefficient of Tc. The ground-truth temperatures obtained using a handheld infrared thermometer were used to calibrate the temperature obtained from the UAV thermal images and to evaluate the Tc extraction results. Measured leaf stomatal conductance values were used to evaluate the performance of the four Tc-based crop water stress indicators. The results showed a strong correlation between ground-truth Tc and Tc extracted by the RGRI-Otsu method proposed in this study, with a coefficient of determination of 0.94 (n=15) and root mean square error value of 0.7 °C. The RGRI-Otsu method was most accurate for estimating temperatures around 32.9 °C, but the magnitude of residuals increased above and below this value. This phenomenon may be attributable to changes in canopy cover (leaf curling) under water stress, resulting in changes in the proportion of exposed sunlit soil in UAV thermal orthophotographs. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of maize canopy detection and extraction, optimal methods and better strategies for eliminating mixed pixels are needed. This study demonstrates the potential of using high-resolution UAV RGB images to a supplement UAV thermal images for the accurate extraction of maize Tc.},

We present various air temperature measurements together with other measurements of meteorological parameters using different sensor systems at a snow-covered and a vegetated site. Measurements from naturally ventilated air temperature sensors in multiplate shields are compared to temperatures measured using sonic anemometers which are unaffected by solar radiation. Over snow, 30 min mean temperature differences can be as large as 10°C. Unshielded thermocouples were also tested and are generally less affected by shortwave radiation. Temperature errors decrease with decreasing solar radiation and increasing wind speed but do not completely disappear at a given solar radiation even in the presence of effective ventilation. We show that temperature errors grow faster for reflected than for incident solar radiation, demonstrating the influence of the surface properties on radiative errors, and we detect the albedo as a variable with major influence on the magnitude of the error as well as a key quantity in possible error correction schemes. An extension is proposed for an existing similarity regression model to correct for radiative errors; thus, surface-reflected shortwave radiation is identified as a principal source of error and the key variable for obtaining a unique nondimensional scaling of radiative errors.},

	abstract = {Climate extremes are likely to occur more frequently in the future, including a combination of heat waves and drought. However, the responses of trees to combined stress and their post-stress recovery are not fully understood yet. Therefore, this study investigates the responses of semi-arid Pinus halepensis seedlings to moderate drought, heat and combined heat-drought stress, as well as post-stress recovery. The seedlings were grown under controlled conditions and exposed to two 4-day-long heat periods, reaching air temperature maxima of 42 °C and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of 7 kPa. Day- and nighttime canopy gas exchange was measured and differences in shoot and root allocation of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) compounds (soluble sugars, starch, cyclitols and carboxylic acids) assessed. Fluorescence parameters, nitrate levels, proline content and shoot water potential (ψ) provided additional indicators for stress severity and recovery performance. During the heat periods, net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance decrease immediately. This decline was modest under well-watered conditions, with transpiration and dark respiration rates remaining high and despite reductions in root NSC content, trees recovered following heat release. This was not the case in the heat-drought treatment, where stress resulted in mortality was high and the few surviving seedlings showed reduced gas exchange rates and low root NSC content, while leaf nitrate and proline remained elevated even three weeks after heat release. Shoot ψ indicated that hydraulic failure was not the reason for mortality in the heat-drought exposed seedlings. Instead, we hypothesize that low transpiration rates, which resulted in needle temperatures {\textgreater}47 °C during heat stress (6 °C above air temperature) have led to irreversible damage. In summary, it could be demonstrated that heat waves in combination with moderate drought can either result in increased mortality or, if the seedlings survive, in delayed recovery. This highlights the potential of an increase in heat wave temperatures to trigger forest decline in semi-arid regions.},

MIR spectral differences among species became more pronounced and unique as leaves matured. Comparison of reflectance spectra of intact vs. dried and ground leaves points to cuticular development—and not internal structural or biochemical changes—as the main driving factor. Accompanying the observed spectral changes was a drop in thermal emissivity from about 0.99 to 0.95 over the eight weeks following leaf emergence. •Emissivity changes were not large enough to substantially influence leaf temperature, but they could potentially lead to a bias in radiometrically-measured temperature of up to 3 K. Our results also point to the potential for using MIR spectroscopy to better understand species-level differences in cuticular development and composition.},

Here, using Arabidopsis as a model system, we study the effects of the accumulation of 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-oxoG), a major product of 1O2-mediated RNA oxidation. We show that 8-oxoG can accumulate in vivo when 1O2 is produced in the cytoplasm. Conditions for such production include the application of RB in the light, dark-to-light transitions in the flu mutant, or subjecting plants to combined dehydration/light exposure. Transcriptomes of these treatments displayed a significant overlap with transcripts stimulated by the cytosolic 80S ribosomal translation inhibitors, cycloheximide and homoharringtonine. We demonstrate that 8-oxoG accumulation correlates with a decrease in RNA translatability, resulting in the rapid decrease of the levels of labile gene repressor elements such as IAA1 and JAZ1 in a proteasome-dependent manner. Indeed, genes regulated by the labile repressors of the jasmonic acid signalling pathway were induced by cycloheximide, RB or dehydration/light treatment independently of the hormone. The results suggest that 1O2, by oxidizing RNA, attenuated cellular translatability and caused specific genes to be released from the repression of their cognate short half-life repressors. The findings here describe a novel means of gene regulation via the direct interaction of 1O2 with RNA.},

It is increasingly recognized that better understanding water use patterns and their response to change depends on our ability to partition evapotranspiration (ET). Here, we use chamber-based direct measurements of soil evaporation (Es) in a semi-arid Pinus halepensis forest to partition ET to Es and tree transpiration (Et), to assess the daily and seasonal changes and to compare annual-scale values with measurements carried out at the same site ten years earlier. The ecosystem is characterized by a high annual Es/ET ratio of 0.26, and an Et/ET of 0.63. Es diminished in the long dry season, but as much as 74 ± 5\% of the residual flux was due to the re-evaporation of nighttime moisture adsorption, which may provide critical protection from soil drying. Over the 10 years observation period concurrent increase in the transpiration ratio (TR=Et/ET; +29\%) and in leaf area index (LAI; +44\%) were observed, with the ratio of TR/LAI remaining constant at {\textasciitilde}0.31, and with persistently closed hydrological balance (ET/P of 0.94–1.07). The observed Et/ET values are similar to the estimated global mean values, but are attained at a much higher aridity index (5.5) than the mean one, demonstrating the potential for expanding forestation into dry regions.},

The objective was to constrain estimates of the carbon (C) storage potential in forest plantations in such semiarid lands, which cover 18\% of the global land area. The forest accumulated 145–160 g C m−2 year−1 over the study period based on the EC and CS approaches, with a mean value of 152.5 ± 30.1 g C m−2 year−1 indicating 20\% uncertainty in carbon uptake estimates. Current total stocks are estimated at 7,943 ± 323 g C/m2 and 372 g N/m2. Carbon accumulated mostly in the soil ( 71\% and 29\% for soil and standing biomass carbon, respectively) with long soil carbon turnover time (59 years). Regardless of unexpected disturbances beyond those already observed at the study site, the results support a considerable carbon sink potential in semiarid soils and forest plantations, and imply that afforestation of even 10\% of semiarid land area under conditions similar to that of the study site, could sequester 0.4 Pg C/year over several decades.},

	abstract = {The solar radiant energy is in fact the only source of energy for the basic physical processes taking place in the atmosphere and on the earth's surface. When passing through the atmosphere and being reflected by the ground surface, solar radiation undergoes changes and conversions. Some of it is absorbed in the atmosphere and converted into other forms of energy, mainly into heat, and some is scattered by gases, by dust and by water vapour. Because of absorption and scattering in the atmosphere, solar radiation is changed by the time it reaches the earth's surface. That part of it which arrives as a beam of parallel rays is referred to as direct solar radiation, and that which is scattered in the atmosphere and reaches the earth's surface from all directions of the sky is called diffuse solar radiation. Both of them are reflected back into the atmosphere when they reach the earth's surface, and this third type of radiation is defined as reflected radiation. All of these radiations differ from solar radiation arriving at the upper level of the atmosphere in intensity as well as in spectral composition although they all fall within the spectral region of solar radiation. In atmospheric physics these types of radiation are known as short-wave radiation (SWR) as distinguished from long-wave or irifrared radiation (L WR) emitted by the atmosphere and the earth's surface.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase in environmental measurements during the past few decades is associated with (1) increasing awareness of the complex relations linking biological responses to atmospheric variables, (2) development of improved data acquisition and handling equipment, (3) the application of modeling to environmental problems, and (4) the implementation of large, cooperative studies of international scope. The consequences of man's possible alteration of the environment have increased our interest in the complex nature of biological responses to meteorological variables. This has generated activity in both measurements and in the application of modeling techniques. The virtual explosion of modeling activity is also associated with the development oflarge computers. The testing of these models has demonstrated the need for more, different, and better environmental data. In addition, technological developments, such as integrated circuits, have reduced the cost, power consumption, and complexity of data acquisition systems, thus promoting more environmental measurements. The emergence of scientific cooperation on a global scale has increased measurement activities markedly. The International Geophysical Year (1958) has been followed by the International Hydrologic Decade, the Inter national Biological Program, the Global Atmospheric Research Program, and a host of environmental studies of a regional nature that have all emphasized field data collection.},

	abstract = {Infrared thermal radiometers (IRTs) are an affordable tool for researchers to monitor canopy temperature. In this maize experiment, six treatments of regulated deficit irrigation levels were evaluated. The main objective was to evaluate these six treatments in terms of six indices (three previously proposed and three introduced in this study) used to quantify water stress. Three are point-in-time indices where one daily reading is assumed representative of the day (Crop Water Stress Index – CWSI, Degrees Above Non-Stressed – DANS, Degrees Above Canopy Threshold – DACT) and three integrate the cumulative impact of water stress over time (Time Temperature Threshold – TTT, Integrated Degrees Above Non-Stressed – IDANS, Integrated Degrees Above Canopy Threshold – IDACT). Canopy temperature was highly correlated with leaf water potential (R2=0.895). To avoid potential bias, the lowest observation from the non-stressed treatment was chosen as the baseline for DANS and IDANS indices. Early afternoon temperatures showed the most divergence and thus this is the ideal time to obtain spot index values. Canopy temperatures and stress indices were responsive to evapotranspiration-based irrigation treatments. DANS and DACT were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold 28°C used in the TTT method, and all indices showed linear relationship with soil water deficit at high temperatures. Recommendations are given to consider soils with high water-holding capacity when choosing a site for non-stressed reference crops used in the DANS method. The DACT may be the most convenient index, as all it requires is a single canopy temperature measurement yet has strong relationships with other indices and crop water measurements.},

We present an assessment of the intra-crown temperature variability and its relationship with water status in two almond cultivars. High-resolution imagery was acquired on 30 June 2009 at 11:30, 14:30, and 16:30h (solar time) with a thermal camera on-board an aircraft over an almond orchard in Kern County, CA, USA. Ten irrigation levels were applied, ensuring a wide variability in water status, and each was replicated eight times. Stem water potential and stomatal conductance were measured on trees of various irrigation regimes at each flight. Significant variation in canopy temperature was found within each crown, probably reflecting differences in stomatal conductance in different parts of the tree crown. The intra-crown standard deviation of canopy temperature (intra-crown σTc) increased from fully irrigated trees to intermediate irrigation levels, diminishing afterwards in the most stressed treatments. Mean canopy temperature was well correlated with stomatal conductance and stem water potential (R2 above 0.65). In trees that had similar mean canopy temperature, intra-crown σTc correlated well with tree water status. Our results quantified in detail the spatial variability in surface temperatures that exists within almond tree crowns and suggest that the intra-crown temperature variation may be a useful indicator of the onset of tree water stress.},

	abstract = {The transpiration of forest growth during the growing season when sufficient soil moisture is available is estimated on the basis of the requirement of water for cooling trees. Tree growth is regarded as a cooler with water as a coolant (evaporative latent heat). Trees are simultaneously warmed up by incident solar radiation and cooled down by the ambient air and by the evaporation of water from the leaf. These parallel, mutually competing processes are described in their simplest form and provide the algorithm for the calculation of the cooling-water requirement. The calculation uses hourly values of air temperature and of global-radiation totals. Properties of the forest growth are expressed in terms of two phenomenological constants — effective absorptivity and effective thickness of leaves. Both are obtained by calibration. The applicability of the proposed calculation was subjected to experimental verification during the course of the growing seasons for 1985–1989 in the mountain watershed LIZ, situated in the National Park S̆umava in the southern part of the Czech Republic. The error in determining evapotranspiration/transpiration is about 5\% of the precipitation over the growing season.},

This should allow the extension of afforestation activities into drier regions. Using eddy flux, physiological and inventory measurements we provide the first quantitative information on such potential from a 35-year old afforestation system of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) at the edge of the Negev desert. This 2800 ha arid-land forest contains 6.5 ± 1.2 kg C m−2, and continues to accumulate 0.13–0.24 kg C m−2 yr−1. The CO2 uptake is highest during the winter, out of phase with most northern hemispheric forest activity. This seasonal offset offers low latitude forests ∼10 ppm higher CO2 concentrations than that available to higher latitude forests during the productive season, in addition to the 30\% increase in mean atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the 1850s. Expanding afforestation efforts into drier regions may be significant for C sequestration and associated benefits (restoration of degraded land, reducing runoff, erosion and soil compaction, improving wildlife) because of the large spatial scale of the regions potentially involved (ca. 2 × 109 ha of global shrub-land and C4 grassland). Quantitative information on forest activities under dry conditions may also become relevant to regions predicted to undergo increasing aridity.},

	abstract = {The distribution of precipitation inputs into different hydrological components of water-limited forest ecosystems determines water availability to trees and consequently forest productivity. We constructed a complete hydrological budget of a semi-arid pine forest (285 mm annual precipitation) by directly measuring its main components: precipitation (P), soil water content, evapotranspiration (ET, eddy covariance), tree transpiration (sap flux), soil evaporation (soil chambers), and intercepted precipitation (calculated). Our results indicated that on average for the 4-year study period, ET accounted for 94\% of P, varying between 100\% when P {\textless} 250 mm and 85\% when P {\textgreater} 300 mm (with indications for losses to subsurface flow and soil moisture storage in wetter years). Direct measurements of the components of the ET flux demonstrated that both transpiration and soil evaporation were significant in this dry forest (45\% and 36\% of ET, respectively). Comparison between ecosystem ET (eddy covariance measurements) and the sum of its measured components showed good agreement on annual scales, but up to 30\% discrepancies (in both directions) on shorter timescales. The pulsed storm pattern, characteristics of semi-arid climates, was sufficient to maintain the topsoil layer wet during the whole wet season. Only less often and intensive storms resulted in infiltration to the root zone, increasing water availability for uptake by deeper roots. Our results indicate that climate change predictions that link reduced precipitation with increased storm intensity may have a smaller effect on water availability to forest ecosystems than reduced precipitation alone, which could help forests' survival and maintain productivity even under drier conditions.

	abstract = {Warming and drying is predicted for most of the Mediterranean and other regions, and knowledge of this effect on forest carbon dynamics cannot be easily extrapolated from temperate climates. Instead, we provide quantitative information from a 6-year study in a 40-year old pine forest at the dry “timberline” (280 mm annual rainfall) on soil CO2 efflux (Fs) and some of its controlling factors. Annual Fs was relatively low (405.9 ± 23.8 g C m−2 a−1), but within one standard deviation of a global nonlinear relationship we derived between mean annual precipitation and Fs in forests. Seasonal variations in Fs were dominated by soil temperature (with Q10 = 2.45) in the wet season, and by soil moisture in the water-limited seasons, but not by pulse responses to precipitation. No temperature sensitivity was observed in the dry season, but there was clear evidence for down regulation of sensitivity to Q10 = 1.18 when soil moisture was kept high by a supplement summer irrigation treatment. Interannual variations in Fs correlated linearly with cumulative rainwater availability, indicating the combined importance of both precipitation amount and its temporal distribution between the wet (and cool) season and the transitional periods characterized by high evaporative demand. Low rates of soil carbon loss combined with high belowground carbon allocation (41\% of canopy CO2 uptake) might explain the high soil organic carbon accumulation and net ecosystem productivity in this dry forest. Our results indicate that Fs in pine forests may adjust to dry conditions with better carbon economy than estimated from response to episodic drought in more temperate climate.},

Soil evaporation accounted for 39\% of average annual ET over the four-year period, and was associated with soil moisture content in the upper 5cm and solar radiation, therefore peaking during the wetting and drying seasons (up to 0.75mmday−1). In the dry summer, Es diminished and as much as 50\% of the residual flux was due to re-evaporation of moisture condensed at night (adsorption). Tree transpiration accounted for 49\% of average annual ET, and was associated with soil moisture at a depth of 10–20cm. Transpiration peaked only in late spring (1.5mmday−1), after the accumulation of large storms allowing infiltration below the topsoil. Moisture at these depths was maintained for longer periods and was even carried over between rain seasons following a high precipitation year. Interception was 12\% of annual ET but was larger than 20\% during the rainy period. The results indicated that both Tt/ET and Es/ET could vary between 30\% and 60\% due to their differential response to seasonal environmental drivers. Annual Tt/ET, a major parameter indicating forest productivity and survival, was more influenced by the occurrence of large storms ({\textgreater}30mm; P30/P ratio) than by P itself. In an assessment of the potential warming and drying trends predicted for the Mediterranean region in the next century, changes in both total precipitation and in its temporal patterns must be considered.},

	abstract = {Predictions of warming and drying in the Mediterranean and other regions require quantifying of such effects on ecosystem carbon dynamics and respiration. Long-term effects can only be obtained from forests in which seasonal drought is a regular feature. We carried out measurements in a semiarid Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine) forest of aboveground respiration rates of foliage, Rf, and stem, Rt over 3 years. Component respiration combined with ongoing biometric, net CO2 flux [net ecosystem productivity (NEP)] and soil respiration measurements were scaled to the ecosystem level to estimate gross and net primary productivity (GPP, NPP) and carbon-use efficiency (CUE=NPP/GPP) using 6 years data. GPP, NPP and NEP were, on average, 880, 350 and 211 g C m−2 yr−1, respectively. The above ground respiration made up half of total ecosystem respiration but CUE remained high at 0.4. Large seasonal variations in both Rf and Rt were not consistently correlated with seasonal temperature trends. Seasonal adjustments of respiration were observed in both the normalized rate (R20) and short-term temperature sensitivity (Q10), resulting in low respiration rates during the hot, dry period. Rf in fully developed needles was highest over winter–spring, and foliage R20 was correlated with photosynthesis over the year. Needle growth occurred over summer, with respiration rates in developing needles higher than the fully developed foliage at most times. Rt showed a distinct seasonal maximum in May irrespective of year, which was not correlated to the winter stem growth, but could be associated with phenological drivers such as carbohydrate re-mobilization and cambial activity. We show that in a semiarid pine forest photosynthesis and stem growth peak in (wet) winter and leaf growth in (dry) summer, and associated adjustments of component respiration, dominated by those in R20, minimize annual respiratory losses. This is likely a key for maintaining high CUE and ecosystem productivity similar to much wetter sites, and could lead to different predictions of the effect of warming and drying climate on productivity of pine forests than based on short-term droughts.},

Self-sustained new needle growth through the dry and hot summer maximized photosynthesis in the following wet season, without straining carbon storage. Low rates of water loss were associated with increasing sensitivity of stomatal conductance (gs) to soil moisture below a relative extractable water (REW) of 0.4, and decreased gs sensitivity to DL below REW of approx. 0.2. This response was captured by the modified Ball–Berry (Leuning) model. • While most physiological parameters and responses measured were typical of temperate pines, the photosynthesis–phenological phasing contributed to high productivity under warm-dry conditions. This contrasts with reported effects of short-term periodical droughts and could lead to different predictions of the effect of warming and drying climate on pine forest productivity.},

Ecophysiological adjustments of key traits, however, could complement these processes and allow sustained survival and growth across a wide range of climatic conditions. This was tested in Pinus halepensis Miller by examining seven physiological and phenological parameters in five provenances growing in three common garden plots along a climatic transect from meso-Mediterranean (MM) to thermo-Mediterranean (TM) and semi-arid (SA) climates. Differential responses to variations in ambient climatic conditions were observed in three key traits: (i) growing season length decreased with drying in all provenances examined (from 165 under TM climate to 100 days under SA climate, on average); (ii) water use efficiency (WUE) increased with drying, but to a different extent in different provenances, and on average from 80, to 95, to 110 µmol CO2 mol−1 H2O under MM, TM and SA climates, respectively; (iii) xylem native embolism was stable across climates, but varied markedly among different provenances (percent loss of conductivity, was below 5\% in two provenances and above 35\% in others). The results indicated that changes in growing season length and WUE were important contributors to tree growth across climates, whereas xylem native embolism negatively correlated with tree survival. The results indicated that irrespective of slow processes (e.g., migration, genetic adaptation), the capacity for ecophysiological adjustments combined with existing variations among provenances could help sustain P. halepensis, a major Mediterranean tree species, under relatively extreme warming and drying climatic trends.},

Our objective was to investigate under controlled conditions the hydraulic adjustments underlying the observed ability of Pinus halepensis to survive seasonal drought under semi-arid conditions. One hundred 18-month saplings were exposed in the greenhouse to 10 different drought treatments, simulating combinations of intensities (fraction of water supply relative to control) and durations (period with no water supply) for 30 weeks. Stomata closed at a leaf water potential (Ψl) of −2.8 MPa, suggesting isohydric stomatal regulation. In trees under extreme drought treatments, stomatal closure reduced CO2 uptake to −1 µmol m−2 s−1, indicating the development of carbon starvation. A narrow hydraulic safety margin of 0.3 MPa (from stomatal closure to 50\% loss of hydraulic conductivity) was observed, indicating a strategy of maximization of CO2 uptake in trees otherwise adapted to water stress. A differential effect of drought intensity and duration was observed, and was explained by a strong dependence of the water stress effect on the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration T/ET and the larger partitioning to transpiration associated with larger irrigation doses. Under intense or prolonged drought, the root system became the main target for biomass accumulation, taking up to 100\% of the added biomass, while the stem tissue biomass decreased, associated with up to 60\% reduction in xylem volume.},

	abstract = {A derivation is presented for the effective atmospheric emissivity to predict downcoming long-wave radiation at ground level under a clear sky and for a nearly standard atmosphere. The results are in good agreement with those obtainable with empirical formulae based on water vapor pressure and temperature. However, the proposed formulation has the advantage that its simple functional form is based on physical grounds without the need for empirical parameters from radiation measurements. Also, in contrast to the empirical equations, it may be adjusted in a simple way to reflect changes in climatic and atmospheric conditions.},

	abstract = {In June 2018, the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission was launched to measure plant temperatures and better understand how they respond to stress. While the ECOSTRESS mission delivers imagery with {\textasciitilde}60 m spatial resolution, it is often useful to have spectra at the leaf level in order to explain variability seen at the pixel level. As it was originally titled, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spectral library version 2.0 has been expanded to support ECOSTRESS studies by including major additions of laboratory measured vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) spectra. The library now contains 541 leaf visible shortwave infrared (VIS/SWIR) spectra, 472 leaf thermal infrared (TIR) spectra, and 51 NPV VIS/SWIR and TIR spectra. Previously, the library primarily contained VSWIR and TIR laboratory spectra of minerals, rocks, and man-made materials. This new library, containing over 3000 spectra, was renamed the ECOSTRESS spectral library version 1.0 and is publicly available (http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov). It should be noted that as with the prior versions of the library, the VSWIR and TIR measurements were made with separate instruments with different calibration sources. Care should be taken when combining the data into a seamless spectrum to cover the entire spectral range. The ECOSTRESS spectral library provides a comprehensive collection of natural and man-made laboratory collected spectra covering the wavelength range of 0.35–15.4 μm.},

Laboratory measured emissivity spectra in the mid infrared (MIR; 2.5μm–6μm) and the thermal infrared (TIR; 8μm–14μm) domain of different plant species, however, reveal significant differences. It is anticipated that with the advances in airborne and space borne hyperspectral thermal sensors, differentiation between plant species may improve. The laboratory emissivity spectra of thirteen common broad leaved species, comprising 3024 spectral bands in the MIR and TIR, were analyzed. For each wavelength the differences between the species were tested for significance using the one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post-hoc Tukey HSD test. The emissivity spectra of the analyzed species were found to be statistically different at various wavebands. Subsequently, six spectral bands were selected (based on the histogram of separable pairs of species for each waveband) to quantify the separability between each species pair based on the Jefferies Matusita (JM) distance. Out of 78 combinations, 76 pairs had a significantly different JM distance. This means that careful selection of hyperspectral bands in the MIR and TIR (2.5μm–14μm) results in reliable species discrimination.},

	abstract = {Field emissivity measurements were made of leaves collected from nine deciduous tree and agricultural plant species. The data show, for the first time, that it is possible to discriminate subtle spectral emissivity features of leaves from the natural background emission. Under conditions of controlled measurement geometry (leaves arranged to cover a flat surface), the field emissivity spectra agreed fairly well with emissivity values calculated from laboratory directional hemispherical reflectance measurements. Spectral features associated with a variety of leaf chemical constituents, including cellulose, cutin, xylan, silica, and oleanolic acid could be identified in the field emissivity data. Structural aspects of leaf surfaces also influenced spectral behavior, notably the abundance of trichomes, as well as wax thickness and texture. Field spectral measurements made at increasing distances from natural plant canopies showed progressive attenuation of the spectral emissivity features. This attenuation is ascribed to increased multiple scattering that superimposes an opposite-in-sign reflected component on the emittance, and to the increasing number of canopy voids within the instrument field of view. Errors associated with the removal of atmospheric features and with the non-isotropic thermal characteristics of canopies also contribute to the loss of spectral information at greater measurement distances. In contrast to visible and short-wave infrared data, thermal infrared spectra of broad leaf plants show considerable spectral diversity, suggesting that such data eventually could be utilized to map vegetation composition. However, remotely measuring the subtle emissivity features of leaves still presents major challenges. To be successful, sensors operating in the 8–14 μm atmospheric window must have high signal-to-noise and a small enough instantaneous field of view to allow measurements of only a few leaf surfaces. Methods for atmospheric compensation, temperature–emissivity separation, and spectral feature analysis also will need to be refined to allow the recognition, and perhaps, exploitation of leaf thermal infrared spectral properties.},

Alternate scenarios may occur at high temperature, including heat avoidance, where leaves increase water loss to evaporatively cool regardless of carbon uptake; or heat failure, where leaves non-adaptively lose water also regardless of carbon uptake. We hypothesized that these alternative scenarios are common in species exposed to hot environments, with heat avoidance more common in species with high construction cost leaves. Diurnal measurements of leaf temperature and gas exchange for 11 Sonoran Desert species revealed that 37\% of these species increased transpiration in the absence of increased carbon uptake. High leaf mass per area partially predicted this behaviour (r2 = 0.39). These data are consistent with heat avoidance and heat failure, but failure is less likely given the ecological dominance of the focal species. These behaviours are not yet captured in any extant plant water use model.},

Construction requirements were to design a unit that uses inexpensive off-the-shelf components, to assemble easily, to facilitate reconfiguration to accommodate various sensors, and to reduce power consumption with the goal of reducing costs and enabling use in sensor networks in remote locations.

At night, thermal imagery revealed no significant differences in surface temperatures of both shields and the air temperature. Both shields produced significant wake within a ±30° sector of incident flow. Even for weak flows ≤0.7 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$, higher-order moments were increased by a factor of 3, while the mean airflow speed was reduced by up to 30\% compared to uncontaminated directions. Careful inspection of the spatiotemporal dynamics of air temperatures in a vertical profile showed negligible impact of the forced aspiration on the finescale structure of the observations for the nocturnal and transitional calm surface layers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The driving force behind the Earth’s climate is radiation from the sun. Incident solar radiation on the Earth’s surface produces differential temperature regimes that, when coupled with the Earth’s rotation around its axis and orbit around the sun, generate wind patterns and ocean currents. These air and water movements in turn influence global patterns of rainfall and heat distribution, generating the diurnal, seasonal and latitudinal changes in climate that occur on the Earth’s surface. In addition to its effects on climate, solar energy is the ultimate source of energy for all life on Earth. Thus, the ability to calculate solar irradiance on a surface, whether it is plant, animal, or non-living is a valuable tool in physiological ecology. The first part of this chapter presents relationships that may be used to calculate solar radiation on idealized surfaces under clear sky conditions.},

During these events, net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) and canopy conductance (gc) decreased by c. 60\%, but evapotranspiration (ET) showed little change. Fast recovery was also observed with fluxes reaching pre-stress values within a day following the event. NEE and gc showed a strong response to vapor pressure deficit that weakened as soil moisture decreased, while sap flow was primarily responding to changes in soil moisture. On an annual scale, heat waves reduced NEE and gross primary productivity by c. 15\% and 4\%, respectively.

The measurements showed a gradual increase in LAIe from ∼1 (±0.25) to ∼1.8 (±0.11) during these years. All instruments, when used properly, gave similar results that were also comparable with actual leaf area index measured by litter collection and destructive sampling and allometric estimates. Because of the constraint of clear sky conditions, which limited the use of the fisheye type sensors to times of twilight, the fisheye techniques were less useful. The tracing radiation and architecture of canopies system, which includes specific treatment of two levels of clumpiness of the sparse forest stand, was used successfully for the intensive monitoring. The mean clumpiness index, 0.61, is considered representative for the specific environment. Finally, the LAIe measurements at the start of each season were used to constrain phenology-based estimates of annual LAIe development, resulting in a continuous course of LAIe in the forest over the five-year period. Intra-seasonal LAIe variation in the order of 10\% of total LAIe predicted by the model was also observed in the intensive TRAC measurements, giving confidence in the TRAC system and indicating its sensitivity and applicability in woodlands even with low LAIe values. The results can be important for forest management decision support as well as for use in evaluation of remote sensing techniques for forests at the lowest range of LAIe values.},

	abstract = {Leaf energy balance may influence plant performance and community composition. While biophysical theory can link leaf energy balance to many traits and environment variables, predicting leaf temperature and key driver traits with incomplete parameterizations remains challenging. Predicting thermal offsets (δ, Tleaf − Tair difference) or thermal coupling strengths (β, Tleaf vs. Tair slope) is challenging. We ask: (a) whether environmental gradients predict variation in energy balance traits (absorptance, leaf angle, stomatal distribution, maximum stomatal conductance, leaf area, leaf height); (b) whether commonly measured leaf functional traits (dry matter content, mass per area, nitrogen fraction, δ13C, height above ground) predict energy balance traits; and (c) how traits and environmental variables predict δ and β among species. We address these questions with diurnal measurements of 41 species co-occurring along a 1,100 m elevation gradient spanning desert to alpine biomes. We show that (a) energy balance traits are only weakly associated with environmental gradients and (b) are not well predicted by common functional traits. We also show that (c) δ and β can be partially approximated using interactions among site environment and traits, with a much larger role for environment than traits. The heterogeneity in leaf temperature metrics and energy balance traits challenges larger-scale predictive models of plant performance under environmental change.

Illus. 1959.—Leaf temperatures were measured with a thermocouple and potentiometer. Readings were taken on leaves of varying thickness, under varying environmental and plant conditions, and during alternating heating and cooling cycles in sun and shade. Leaves tended to assume air temperature. Sunshine heated thin leaves 6–10°C. above the air in about 1 min. Very thick leaves were heated 20°C. above air in 20–30 min. Cooling in still air in shade was at the same rate as heating in sunshine, and the product of this rate times leaf mass in g./cm.2 was constant for all leaves tested. Wind at 5 m.p.h. lowered leaf temperature in the sun about half way to air temperature. This cooling effect can result in a reduction of transpiration by wind. Transpiration had a minor effect on leaf temperature. Wilted leaves showed nearly the same temperature response as turgid ones. Dried leaves heated less and cooled faster in shade than transpiring leaves. Vaselined leaves were 1–3°C. warmer than transpiring leaves but showed similar heating and cooling curves.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The Penman–Monteith (PM) equation is commonly considered the most advanced physically based approach to computing transpiration rates from plants considering stomatal conductance and atmospheric drivers. It has been widely evaluated at the canopy scale, where aerodynamic and canopy resistance to water vapour are difficult to estimate directly, leading to various empirical corrections when scaling from leaf to canopy. Here, we evaluated the PM equation directly at the leaf scale, using a detailed leaf energy balance model and direct measurements in a controlled, insulated wind tunnel using artificial leaves with fixed and predefined stomatal conductance. Experimental results were consistent with a detailed leaf energy balance model; however, the results revealed systematic deviations from PM-predicted fluxes, which pointed to fundamental problems with the PM equation. Detailed analysis of the derivation by Monteith(1965) and subsequent amendments revealed two errors: one in neglecting two-sided exchange of sensible heat by a planar leaf, and the other related to the representation of hypostomatous leaves, which are very common in temperate climates. The omission of two-sided sensible heat flux led to bias in simulated latent heat flux by the PM equation, which was as high as 50 \% of the observed flux in some experiments. Furthermore, we found that the neglect of feedbacks between leaf temperature and radiative energy exchange can lead to additional bias in both latent and sensible heat fluxes. A corrected set of analytical solutions for leaf temperature as well as latent and sensible heat flux is presented, and comparison with the original PM equation indicates a major improvement in reproducing experimental results at the leaf scale. The errors in the original PM equation and its failure to reproduce experimental results at the leaf scale (for which it was originally derived) propagate into inaccurate sensitivities of transpiration and sensible heat fluxes to changes in atmospheric conditions, such as those associated with climate change (even with reasonable present-day performance after calibration). The new formulation presented here rectifies some of the shortcomings of the PM equation and could provide a more robust starting point for canopy representation and climate change studies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although both processes harvest the energy in sunlight, they operate in distinctly different ways and produce different types of products: biomass or chemical fuels in the case of natural photosynthesis and nonstored electrical current in the case of photovoltaics. In order to find common ground for evaluating energy-conversion efficiency, we compare natural photosynthesis with present technologies for photovoltaic-driven electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen. Photovoltaic-driven electrolysis is the more efficient process when measured on an annual basis, yet short-term yields for photosynthetic conversion under optimal conditions come within a factor of 2 or 3 of the photovoltaic benchmark. We consider opportunities in which the frontiers of synthetic biology might be used to enhance natural photosynthesis for improved solar energy conversion efficiency.},

Even very slight forced-air movements markedly increased heat dissipation in this range of mixed free and forced convection. Lobed plates were more effective dissipators than circles, with the greatest differences occurring where flow was normal to the plate. Circular plates dissipated about one-fourth more heat when vertical than when horizontal in still air (free convection). By contrast, dissipation was essentially independent of orientation for extensively lobed models. Under some circumstances, maximum dissipation occurred with lobed plates oblique to a forced air stream. Physical explanations and biological implications of these results are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the present study we explored the possibility of assessing the allocation of photons absorbed by photosystem II (PSII) antennae to thermal energy dissipation and photosynthetic electron transport in leaves of several plant species under field conditions. Changes in chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were determined in situ over the course of an entire day in the field in sun-exposed leaves of two species with different maximal rates of photosynthesis, Helianthus annuus (sunflower) and Vinca major. Leaves of Vinca minor (periwinkle) growing in a deeply shaded location were also monitored. We propose using diurnal changes in the efficiency of open PSII centers (F′v/F′m) in these sun and shade leaves to (a) assess diurnal changes in the allocation of absorbed light to photochemistry and thermal energy dissipation and, furthermore, (b) make an estimate of changes in the rate of thermal energy dissipation, an analogous expression to the rate of photochemistry. The fraction of light absorbed in PSII antennae that is dissipated thermally (D) is proposed to be estimated from D = 1-F′v/F′m, in analogy to the widely used estimation of the fraction of light absorbed in PSII antennae (P) that is utilized in PSII photochemistry from P = F′v/F′m× qP (where qP is the coefficient for photochemical quenching; Genty, B., Briantais, J.-M. \& Baker, N. R. 1989. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 990: 87-92). The rate of thermal dissipation is consequently given by D × PFD (photon flux density), again in analogy to the rate of photochemistry P × PFD, both assuming a matching behavior of photosystems I and II. Characterization of energy dissipation from the efficiency of open PSII centers allows an assessment from a single set of measurements at any time of day; this is particularly useful under field conditions where the fully relaxed reference values of variable or maximal fluorescence needed for the computation of nonphotochemical quenching may not be available. The usefulness of the assessment described above is compared with other currently used parameters to quantify nonphotochemical and photochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching.},

The lower action in the UV and blue was seen in leaves having higher absorptance in the green, and a very close correlation (r=−0.920) was found between the ratio of action at 435 nm to that at 560 nm and the absorptance at 560 nm (A560). These facts proved that the variation of action spectra in the range from the UV to the green depended largely on the differences in absorptance of leaves in the green, and a curve with a pronounced second peak in the blue could be obtained when the A560 was less than about 0.6.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the effects of leaf pigmentation (related to leaf ontogeny), on the spectral dependence of photosynthesis and most observations have been limited so far to single leaves. This study aimed to investigate photosynthesis and the related optical properties of two types of rose leaves, young reddish leaves and middle age green leaves, and to quantify the spectral dependence of photosynthesis at the canopy level. Photosynthesis was measured with CO2/H2O gas analyzer on intact leaves of rose ‘Akito’ at narrow band light of 18 wavelengths. Subsequently, the optical properties (transmittance, absorptance and reflectance) were measured with spectrophotometer. A mechanistic crop model was used for up scaling measurements at the single leaf level to the crop level (crop with LAI=3). The green and the reddish leaves had similar total PAR absorptance, even though absorptance around 550nm was slightly lower in the green leaves. The maxima of photosynthesis efficiency were at 640–680nm for quantum yield (per absorbed light unit) and at 660–680nm for action spectrum (per incident light unit), regardless the colour of the leaf blade. In the range 500–580nm, both the quantum yield and the action spectrum were lower in reddish than in green leaves. Differences in optical properties and photosynthetic behaviour were related to the higher content of anthocyanins in red leaves. The spectral dependence of light absorption and photosynthesis at the canopy level differed distinctly from that at leaf level. The spectral differences in absorption at the leaf level almost disappeared at the canopy level. Consequently, while the action spectrum of green light (520–570nm) was only 67\% of that of red light (680nm) at the leaf level, it increased to 79\% at the crop level. Young reddish leaves had higher absorptance but lower action spectrum and quantum yield at green light. Spectral differences in photosynthesis at the canopy level are much smaller than at the leaf level. Our short term measurements suggest that optimizing spectral output of LED lamps may increase photosynthesis up to 12\% for a canopy with green leaves and up to 17\% for a canopy with reddish leaves when compared to the spectrum of HPS lamps.},

	abstract = {Exceeding thermal thresholds causes irreversible damage and ultimately loss of leaves. The lowland tropics are among the warmest forested biomes, but little is known about heat tolerance of tropical forest plants. We surveyed leaf heat tolerance of sun‐exposed leaves from 147 tropical lowland and pre‐montane forest species by determining the temperatures at which potential photosystem II efficiency based on chlorophyll a fluorescence started to decrease (TCrit) and had decreased by 50\% (T50). TCrit averaged 46.7°C (5th–95th percentile: 43.5–49.7°C) and T50 averaged 49.9°C (47.8–52.5°C). Heat tolerance partially adjusted to site temperature; TCrit and T50 decreased with elevation by 0.40°C and 0.26°C per 100m, respectively, while mean annual temperature decreased by 0.63°C per 100m. The phylogenetic signal in heat tolerance was weak, suggesting that heat tolerance is more strongly controlled by environment than by evolutionary legacies. TCrit increased with the estimated thermal time constant of the leaves, indicating that species with thermally buffered leaves maintain higher heat tolerance. Among lowland species, T50 increased with leaf mass per area, suggesting that in species with structurally more costly leaves the risk of leaf loss during hot spells is reduced. These results provide insight in variation in heat tolerance at local and regional scales.

It correctly predicted the resistance for water vapor movement across the boundary layers adjacent to the (cylindrical) inflorescence stems of Xanthorrhoea australis R. Br. and Scirpus validus Vahl and the leaves of Allium cepa L. The boundary-layer thickness decreased as the turbulence intensity increased.

	abstract = {Numerical-weather-prediction models resolve mean variable at the scale of their grid length only. Effective surface parameters must, therefore, be used to relate the mean properties of humidity, temperature and wind speed to the mean surface fluxes. The effective parameters can be calculated using a model with a finer grid. In this paper effective aerodynamic and surface resistances to sensible-and latent-heat flux for a surface which varies over a horizontal scale of one kilometre are calculated from a two-dimensional model with a grid size of 30m, and compared with simpler averaging techniques. The averaging techniques considered include taking the mean of the aerodynamic and surface resistance in parallel or in series, the mean of the solutions given by these two, and a heuristic model that treats the different surface covers independently but assumes that they are exposed to the same mean meteorological variables at a blending height. The heuristic model consistently estimates the effective resistances to within 25\% but, in comparison to the other methods, requires more information. For heterogeneous surfaces, the effective parameters for momentum and sensible- and latent-heat transfer do not bear the same relationship to each other as they do for homogenous surfaces. Effective parameters for each type of flux, therefore, have to be calculated separately. In situations where negative sensible-heat fluxes occur over rough ground, the effective resistance to sensible-heat flux can be very large, becoming underfined in the extreme case where the area-average sensible-heat flux is zero.},

Measurement of stomatal conductance and leaf temperature has traditionally been done by using porometers or gas exchange analyzers and fine-wire thermocouples attached to the leaves, which are labor intensive and point measurements. The advent of remote or proximal thermal sensing technologies has provided the potential for scaling up to leaves, plants, and canopies. Thermal cameras with a temperature resolution of {\textless}0.1 K now allow one to study the temperature variation within and between plants. This chapter discusses some applications of infrared thermography for assessing drought and other abiotic and biotic stress and outlines some of the main factors that need to be considered when applying this to the study of leaf or canopy temperature whether in controlled environments or in the field.},

If diminished water availability decreases latent heat flux at the leaf surface, a complementary increase of sensible heat will occur and create a larger temperature difference between foliage and air. Radiation, air temperature, humidity and wind speed modify leaf temperature and may mask indications of water stress. The position, inclination and orientation of leaves within the canopy also produce considerable variation of leaf temperature. These factors were incorporated in a linear transpiration model, using physical and physiological characteristics of cotton. Water stress was simulated by imposing a limit value for stomatal conductance. The energy balance equation was solved as a function of angle between leaf and solar beam, to determine leaf temperature frequency distribution. The results show that stress induced temperature rise occurs over a small percentage of the total leaf area. Detection of moderate stress requires a normalizing procedure which takes into account meteorological conditions. The leaf temperature distribution is a better indicator of stress than the average value.},

	abstract = {Afforestation in semi-arid regions can potentially enhance the global carbon sink by increasing the terrestrial biomass. However, the survival of planted forests under such extreme environmental conditions is not guaranteed a priori, and critically depends on the surface–atmosphere exchange of energy. We investigate the pine forest Yatir in Israel, an example of a man-made semi-arid ecosystem, by means of large-eddy simulations. We focus on the interaction between surface–atmosphere exchange and secondary circulations that couple the isolated forest to the surrounding shrubland. The large-eddy simulations feature a grid resolution that resolves the forest canopy in several layers, and are initialized by satellite data and Doppler lidar, eddy-covariance and radiosonde measurements. We perform three large-eddy simulations with different geostrophic wind speeds to investigate the influence of those wind speeds on the surface–atmosphere exchange. We reproduce the measured mean updrafts above the forest and mean downdrafts above the shrubland, which increase in strength with decreasing geostrophic wind speed. The largest updrafts emerge above the older, denser part of the forest, triggering secondary circulations. The spatial extent of these circulations does not cover the entire forest area, although we observe a reduced aerodynamic resistance in the regions of updraft. Our simulations indicate that the enhanced surface–atmosphere exchange of the Yatir forest is not sufficient to compensate for the increased net radiation, due to the lower albedo of the forest with respect to the surroundings, resulting in higher air temperatures inside the forest. However, the difference between the forest and shrubland temperatures decreases with increasing geostrophic wind speed due to reduction in the aerodynamic resistance.},

	abstract = {Tropical forests are hyper-diverse and perform critical functions that regulate global climate, yet they are also threatened by rising temperatures. Canopy temperatures depart considerably from air temperatures, sometimes by as much as air temperatures are projected to increase by the end of this century; however, canopy temperatures are rarely measured or considered in climate change analyses. Our results from near-continuous thermal imaging of a well-studied tropical forest show that canopy temperatures reached a maximum of 34°C, and exceeded maximum air temperatures by as much as 7°C. Comparing different canopy surfaces reveals that bark was the warmest, followed by a deciduous canopy, flowers, and coolest was an evergreen canopy. Differences among canopy surfaces were largest during afternoon hours, when the evergreen canopy cooled more rapidly than other canopy surfaces, presumably due to transpiration. Gross primary productivity (GPP), estimated from eddy covariance measurements, was more strongly associated with canopy temperatures than air temperatures or vapor pressure deficit. The rate of GPP increase with canopy temperatures slowed above 28–29°C, but GPP continued to increase until 31–32°C. Although future warming is projected to be greater in high-latitude regions, we show that tropical forest productivity is highly sensitive to small changes in temperature. Important biophysical and physiological characteristics captured by canopy temperatures allow more accurate predictions of GPP compared to commonly used air temperatures. Results suggest that as air temperatures continue to warm with climate change, canopy temperatures will increase at a 40\% higher rate, with uncertain but potentially large impacts on tropical forest productivity.},

This study evaluated the accuracy of TIR measurements of a conifer tree that were made using the thermal camera’s factory default settings, and developed a post-collection data processing method to correct measurements for ambient conditions that depart from the factory default settings. We conducted a 42-day measurement campaign in Corvallis, Oregon during spring 2014 that focused on the canopy temperature of a noble fir (Abies procera) and included the simultaneous collection of meteorological data and leaf temperature measurements with an array of thermocouples. We then developed empirical functions for temperature corrections that better accounted for emissivity, and atmospheric and reflected temperature. The original TIR temperatures using the factory settings averaged 8.6±5.6°C (−4.2 to 25.4°C in range), and the original TIR temperatures differed from the thermocouple temperatures by 1.4–1.6K. The TIR temperatures were generally accurate, except for a low temperature bias at leaf temperatures below 5°C. TIR temperature corrections reduced this bias to a {\textless}1.0K mean error relative to the thermocouples. Our results show that TIR measurements can be corrected to more accurately quantify canopy temperature, and that the importance of this correction increases under more extreme ambient conditions, such as colder periods.},

In this study, we applied a thermal camera to measure canopy skin temperatures in a mature ponderosa pine forest in central Oregon over one growing season from May to September 2014. This study had the following objectives: (1) to examine spatial and temporal variations of canopy temperature; (2) to explore the effects of climate and soil conditions on canopy temperature; and (3) to quantify the relationships of canopy temperatures to forest-atmosphere heat and carbon fluxes. The temporal variation of 30-min mean canopy temperature was large, and leaf temperatures ranged from −2.1 to 33.6 °C during the study period. The temperature difference was small between the whole canopy and leaf regions, while tree stems had warmer temperatures than leaves, especially during the afternoon (12:00–19:59 h). The canopy thermal regime was largely controlled by climatic conditions and related to the soil thermal states. Air temperature, relative humidity, longwave radiation, and soil temperature at 2-cm depth were tightly correlated with 30-min and daily/sub-daily mean canopy leaf temperatures (r ≥ 0.6 or ≤ − 0.6, p \&lt; 0.01). The daily/sub-daily mean canopy temperatures contained stronger relationships with the climatic and soil variables than the 30-min mean temperatures. During the afternoon, the mean leaf temperature was more closely related to net ecosystem exchange (r2 = 0.69) than air temperature, driven by the strong relationship between tissue temperature and photosynthesis and respiration. Our results show that canopy thermal conditions can be monitored almost continuously for extended time periods to better characterize how canopies respond to environmental conditions. Finally, thermal measurements show great promise for quantifying linkages to carbon exchange in forest ecosystems.},

Individual leaf temperature may deviate strongly from air temperature, and may vary throughout the canopy. Measurements of leaf temperature, conducted at a high spatial and temporal resolution, can improve our understanding of leaf water loss, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rates, phenology, and atmosphere-ecosystem exchanges. However, continuous high-resolution measurement of leaf temperature outside of a controlled environment is difficult and rarely done. Here, thermal infrared cameras are used to measure leaf temperatures. We describe two long-term field measurement sites: one in a temperature deciduous forest, and the other in a subalpine conifer forest. The considerations and constraints for deploying such cameras are discussed and the temperature errors are typically +/–1 °C or smaller (σ = 0.60 °C, 2σ = 1.20 °C). Lastly, we compare leaf temperature by species and height at hourly to multi-seasonal timescales and show that on average, leaf temperature is warmer than air temperature in a temperate forest. Leaf temperature can be uniform or heterogeneous across a scene, depending on canopy structure, leaf habit, and meteorology. With this data, we verify that leaf temperature follows classic expectations, yet exhibits noteworthy departures that require additional study and theoretical consideration.},

It is widely used in teaching school and undergraduate courses on climate. It is also still in regular use by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis for climatic regionalisation of variables and for assessing the output of global climate models. Here we have produced a new global map of climate using the Köppen-Geiger system based on a large global data set of long-term monthly precipitation and temperature station time series. Climatic variables used in the Köppen-Geiger system were calculated at each station and interpolated between stations using a two-dimensional (latitude and longitude) thin-plate spline with tension onto a 0.1\&deg;\&times;0.1\&deg; grid for each continent. We discuss some problems in dealing with sites that are not uniquely classified into one climate type by the Köppen-Geiger system and assess the outcomes on a continent by continent basis. Globally the most common climate type by land area is BWh (14.2\%, Hot desert) followed by Aw (11.5\%, Tropical savannah).

The body of the discussion here then shows that the tools for modeling exist at diverse levels of process detail. Modelers are able to assemble a workable toolkit from the whole set of such tools. I present explicit equations for leaves in isolation and in canopies. Toward enabling comprehensive process-based modeling, I discuss energy-balance modeling in the forward direction for prediction of photosynthesis, transpiration, and other measures, including collateral effects such as leaf damage from excess temperatures. Included here are several useful mathematical solution methods for highly-coupled processes, such as energy balance, photosynthesis, stomatal control, and scalar transport. I review inverse modeling to estimate evapotranspiration and plant water stress from measured leaf temperatures. Quantitative arguments indicate the range and limits of validity of various approximations, such as ignoring lateral heat conduction in the leaf lamina or, on certain time-scales, transients in leaf temperature. Overall, the review emphasizes the importance of including the energy balance in models and provides suggestions for making practical error estimates of process-model inaccuracies and process incompleteness. The current limitations compel the development of improved models.},

In the wake region of the isolated building, both predicted mean wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy by the modified k−ε model are slightly underestimated due to lack of the vortex shedding in the simulation. On the other hand, LES model well predicts both mean wind speed and turbulent kinetic energy since all large vortices are directly resolved by LES model.},

	abstract = {Successful restoration of degraded forest landscapes requires reference models that adequately capture structural heterogeneity at multiple spatial scales and for specific landforms. Despite this need, managers often lack access to reliable reference information, in large part because field-based methods for assessing variation in forest structure are costly and inherently suffer from limited replication and spatial coverage and, therefore, yield limited insights about the ecological structure of reference forests at landscape scales. LiDAR is a cost-effective alternative that can provide high-resolution characterizations of variation in forest structure among landform types. However, managers and researchers have been reluctant to use LiDAR for characterizing structure because of low confidence in its capacity to approximate actual tree distributions. By calculating bias in LiDAR estimates for a range of tree-height cutoffs, we improved LiDAR’s ability to capture structural variability in terms of individual trees. We assessed bias in the processed LiDAR data by comparing datasets of field-measured and LiDAR-detected trees of various height classes in terms of overall number of trees and estimates of structure and spatial pattern in an important contemporary reference forest, the Sierra de San Pedro Martir National Park, Baja California, Mexico. Agreement between LiDAR- and field-based estimates of tree density, as well as estimates of forest structure and spatial pattern, was maximized by removing trees less than 12 m tall. We applied this height cutoff to LiDAR-detected trees of our study landscape, and asked if forest structure and spatial pattern varied across topographic settings. We found that canyons, shallow northerly, and shallow southerly slopes were structurally similar; each had a greater number of all trees, large trees, and large tree clumps than steep southerly slopes and ridges. Steep northerly slopes supported unique structures, with taller trees than ridges and shorter trees than canyons and shallow southerly slopes. Our results show that characterizations of forest structure based on LiDAR-detected trees are reasonably accurate when the focus is narrowed to the overstory. In addition, our finding of strong variation of forest structure and spatial pattern across topographic settings demonstrates the importance of developing reference models at the landscape scale, and highlights the need for replicated sampling among stands and landforms. Methods developed here should be useful to managers interested in using LiDAR to characterize distributions of medium and large overstory trees, particularly for the development of landscape-scale reference models.},

The Reynolds number dependence of flow at the top of and above the forest canopy was investigated for simulated atmospheric boundary-layer flows with different free stream velocities. For the windward edge region, including a downstream distance of 5.7 tree heights, the flow field of the mean streamwise velocity was identified to be independent of the Reynolds number at Reh ≥ 31,000 (Reh based on undisturbed approach flow velocity at canopy top) and at Reh ≥ 50,000 for further flow quantities (fluctuation velocity, Reynolds stress, vorticity, turbulence kinetic energy, shear production). The dependence for lower Reynolds numbers was attributed to differences in the structure of small-scale wakes arising from flow and separation in and at the top of the forest canopy and to a change in the ratio of bulk momentum of the flow in the forest canopy to that of the flow above in the free air region. The threshold Reynolds number Reh,t depends on the distance from the leading edge as long as the flow still adjusts to the forest canopy before reaching the equilibrium region, rather than being a fixed value.},

It was found that this thermocouple measured the air temperature with root-mean-square errors of 0.35 K within the Gill shield without correction. A linear temperature correction was evaluated based on the difference between the interior plate and thermocouple temperatures. This correction was found to be relatively insensitive to shield design and yielded an error of 0.16 K for combined day and night observations. The correction was reliable in the daytime when the wind speed usually exceeds 1 m s−1 but occasionally performed poorly at night during very light winds. Inspection of the standard deviation in the thermocouple wire temperature identified these periods but did not unambiguously locate the most serious events. However, estimates of sensor accuracy during these periods is complicated by the much larger sampling volume of the mechanically-aspirated sensor compared with the naturally-aspirated sensor and the presence of significant near-surface temperature gradients. The root-mean-square errors therefore are upper limits to the aspiration error since they include intrinsic sensor differences and intermittent volume sampling differences.},

Although plants are often considered to be poikilotherms, the data suggest that they are instead limited homeotherms. Leaf functional traits that promote limited homeothermy are adaptive because homeothermy maximizes instantaneous and lifetime carbon gain.

Self-sustained new needle growth through the dry and hot summer maximized photosynthesis in the following wet season, without straining carbon storage. Low rates of water loss were associated with increasing sensitivity of stomatal conductance (gs) to soil moisture below a relative extractable water (REW) of 0.4, and decreased gs sensitivity to DL below REW of approx. 0.2. This response was captured by the modified Ball–Berry (Leuning) model. • While most physiological parameters and responses measured were typical of temperate pines, the photosynthesis–phenological phasing contributed to high productivity under warm-dry conditions. This contrasts with reported effects of short-term periodical droughts and could lead to different predictions of the effect of warming and drying climate on pine forest productivity.},

	abstract = {Thermal macrophysiology is an established research field that has led to well-described patterns in the global structuring of climate adaptation and risk. However, since it was developed primarily in animals, we lack information on how general these patterns are across organisms. This is alarming if we are to understand how thermal tolerances are distributed globally, improve predictions of climate change, and mitigate effects. We approached this knowledge gap by compiling a geographically and taxonomically extensive database on plant heat and cold tolerances and used this dataset to test for thermal macrophysiological patterns and processes in plants. We found support for several expected patterns: Cold tolerances are more variable and exhibit steeper latitudinal clines and stronger relationships with local environmental temperatures than heat tolerances overall. Next, we disentangled the importance of local environments and evolutionary and biogeographic histories in generating these patterns. We found that all three processes have significantly contributed to variation in both heat and cold tolerances but that their relative importance differs. We also show that failure to simultaneously account for all three effects overestimates the importance of the included variable, challenging previous conclusions drawn from less comprehensive models. Our results are consistent with rare evolutionary innovations in cold acclimation ability structuring plant distributions across biomes. In contrast, plant heat tolerances vary mainly as a result of biogeographical processes and drift. Our results further highlight that all plants, particularly at mid-to-high latitudes and in their nonhardened state, will become increasingly vulnerable to ongoing climate change.},

Metabolic theory predicts that many rates increase exponentially with temperature following an activation energy (E) of 0.32 eV for photosynthesis. Here, I evaluate this prediction for net photosynthesis and organ, individual, and ecosystem growth. Observed E for photosynthesis varied widely but was not statistically different from predictions, while E for organs was greater than predicted, and E for individuals and ecosystems only weakly characterized temperature responses. I review several hypotheses that may underlie these results. Understanding how multiple rate-limiting processes coalesce into a single E that characterizes metabolic responses to temperature, and how to best estimate E from unimodal data, remain important challenges.},

	abstract = {Trees regulate canopy temperature (Tc) via transpiration to maintain an optimal temperature range. In diverse forests such as those of the eastern United States, the sensitivity of Tc to changing environmental conditions may differ across species, reflecting wide variability in hydraulic traits. However, these links are not well understood in mature forests, where Tc data have historically been difficult to obtain. Recent advancement of thermal imaging cameras (TICs) enables Tc measurement of previously inaccessible tall trees. By leveraging TIC and sap flux measurements, we investigated how co-occurring trees (Quercus alba, Q. falcata, and Pinus virginiana) change their Tc and vapor pressure deficit near the canopy surface (VPDc) in response to changing air temperature (Ta) and atmospheric VPD (VPDa). We found a weaker cooling effect for the species that most strongly regulates stomatal function during dry conditions (isohydric; P. virginiana). Specifically, the pine had higher Tc (up to 1.3°C) and VPDc (up to 0.3 kPa) in the afternoon and smaller sensitivity of both ∆T (=Tc − Ta) and ∆VPD (=VPDc − VPDa) to changing conditions. Furthermore, significant differences in Tc and VPDc between sunlit and shaded portions of a canopy implied a non-evaporative effect on Tc regulation. Specifically, Tc was more homogeneous within the pine canopy, reflecting differences in leaf morphology that allow higher canopy transmittance of solar radiation. The variability of Tc among species (up to 1.3°C) was comparable to the previously reported differences in surface temperature across land cover types (1°C to 2°C), implying the potential for significant impact of species composition change on local/regional surface temperature.},

	abstract = {Climate warming has advanced leaf unfolding of trees and shrubs, thus extending the growing period but potentially exposing plants to increased frost risk. The relative shifts in the timing of leaf unfolding vs. the timing and intensity of frost events determine whether frost risk changes under climate warming. Here we test whether the frost risk for unfolding leaves of 13 European tree and shrub species has changed over more than 60 years using dynamic state-space models and phenological observations from 264 sites located between 200 and 1900 m a.s.l. across Switzerland. Trees and shrubs currently feature sufficient safety margins regarding frost risk, which increase from early- to late-leafing species and tend to decrease with increasing elevation. Particularly after 1970 to 1990 and at higher elevations, leaf unfolding has advanced across all species. While the time between the last critical frost and leaf unfolding has shifted from predominantly positive trends in the late 1950s and 1960s to a trend reversal since the 2000s, the minimum temperature during leaf unfolding has mostly increased since the 1980s. These dynamic shifts in leaf unfolding and frost risk demonstrate species- and site-specific responses of trees and shrubs to climate cooling and warming.},

	abstract = {The relationship between specific humidity (q) and down-welling long-wave radiation (El↓) was investigated on a daily, monthly and annual basis for 39 widely distributed sites of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and validated using two additional BSRN sites. A power relationship between El↓ and q was fitted to the data for each site; the constant did not change significantly with time and geographic location. Neither the mean value of q nor the residual value of El↓ changed significantly between 1998 and 2011, suggesting the applicability of the relationship over periods without large changes in the Earth's temperature and/or concentration of H2O. The root mean square error for both the calibration and validation sites was comparable to that reported for both direct measurements and satellite-derived estimates for daily, monthly and annual periods. The power relationships were weaker for three tropical sites located in the Pacific Ocean, where the seasonal variation in q was smaller than at the other sites. For the remaining stations, a common power relationship, El↓ = 212.64 q0.22, enabled monthly values of El↓ to be accurately estimated from widely available measurements of air temperature, humidity and pressure at the Earth's surface.},

Absorption in the infrared is about 5\% at 800 to 1,200 mμ and increases to near 100\% beyond, 3,000 m(μ) or 3 μ. Absorption at 550 mμ by equal quantities of leaf pigments was two to six times greater for intact leaves than for methanol solutions. Shifts of the absorption bands toward shorter wavelengths, which are characteristic of chlorophyll solutions, were not observed in isolated whole or sonically disintegrated chloroplasts. Leaves in sunlight are heated from a few degrees above air temperature for thin leaves to 30 degrees C or more for very thick leaves before reaching a steady temperature. The heating and cooling curves shown by wilted leaves were not significantly different from those of transpiring leaves. Dried leaves heated less and cooled faster than normal, transpiring leaves. Leaves in sunshine were cooled quickly toward air temperature by wind at 5 mph. It is concluded that leaves tend to assume the temperature of the surrounding air; that they are heated rapidly by radiant energy, and cooled primarily by conduction of energy to the air.},

	abstract = {Evidence is mounting that temperate-zone reforestation cools surface temperature (Tsurf), mitigating deleterious effects of climate warming. While Tsurf drives many biophysical processes, air temperature (Ta) is an equally important target for climate mitigation and adaptation. Whether reductions in Tsurf translate to reductions in Ta remains complex, fraught by several nonlinear and intertwined processes. In particular, forest canopy structure strongly affects near-surface temperature gradients, complicating cross-site comparison. Here the influence of reforestation on Ta is assessed by targeting temperature metrics that are less sensitive to local canopy effects. Specifically, we consider the aerodynamic temperature (Taero), estimated using a novel procedure that does not rely on the assumptions of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, as well as the extrapolated temperature into the surface layer (Textrap). The approach is tested with flux tower data from a grass field, pine plantation, and mature hardwood stand co-located in the Duke Forest (North Carolina, USA). During growing season daytime periods, Tsurf is 4–6 °C cooler, and Taero and near-surface Textrap are 2–3 °C cooler, in the forests relative to the grassland. During the dormant season, daytime differences are smaller but still substantial. At night, differences in Taero are small, and near-surface Textrap is warmer over forests than grasslands during the growing season (by 0.5 to 1 °C). Finally, the influence of land cover on Textrap at the interface between the surface and mixed layer is small. Overall, reforestation appears to provide a meaningful opportunity for adaption to warmer daytime Ta in the southeastern United States, especially during the growing season.},

To date, however, most studies were conducted in situations when/where changes in both SIF and GPP were driven by large changes in the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and phenology. Here we quantified SIF and GPP during a short-term intense heat wave at a Mediterranean pine forest, during which changes in APAR were negligible. GPP decreased linearly during the course of the heat wave, while SIF declined slightly initially and then dropped dramatically during the peak of the heat wave, temporally coinciding with a biochemical impairment of photosynthesis inferred from the increase in the uptake ratio of carbonyl sulfide to carbon dioxide. SIF thus accounted for less than 35\% of the variability in GPP and, even though it responded to the impairment of photosynthesis, appears to offer limited potential for quantitatively monitoring GPP during heat waves in the absence of large changes in APAR.},

Direct measurements of surface emissivity are difficult when there is considerable background radiation at the same wavelength as the emitted radiation. This occurs, for example, when objects at temperatures near room temperature are measured in a terrestrial environment by use of the infrared 8–14-μm band. This problem is usually treated by assumption of a perfectly diffuse surface or of diffuse background radiation. However, real surfaces and actual background radiation are not diffuse; therefore there will be a systematic measurement error. It is demonstrated that, in some cases, the deviations from a diffuse behavior lead to large errors in the measured emissivity. Past measurements made with simplifying assumptions should therefore be reevaluated and corrected. Recommendations are presented for improving experimental procedures in emissivity measurement.},

	abstract = {Surface temperature drives many ecological processes and infrared thermography is widely used by ecologists to measure the thermal heterogeneity of different species' habitats. However, the potential bias in temperature readings caused by distance between the surface to be measured and the camera is still poorly acknowledged. We examined the effect of distance from 0.3 to 80m on a variety of thermal metrics (mean temperature, standard deviation, patch richness and aggregation) under various weather conditions and for different structural complexity of the studied surface types (various surfaces with vegetation). We found that distance is a key modifier of the temperature measured by a thermal infrared camera. A non-linear relationship between distance and mean temperature, standard deviation and patch richness led to a rapid under-estimation of the thermal metrics within the first 20m and then only a slight decrease between 20 and 80m from the object. Solar radiation also enhanced the bias with increasing distance. Therefore, surface temperatures were under-estimated as distance increased and thermal mosaics were homogenized at long distances with a much stronger bias in the warmer than the colder parts of the distributions. The under-estimation of thermal metrics due to distance was explained by atmospheric composition and the pixel size effect. The structural complexity of the surface had little effect on the surface temperature bias. Finally, we provide general guidelines for ecologists to minimize inaccuracies caused by distance from the studied surface in thermography.},

	abstract = {Canopy and aerodynamic conductances (gC and gA) are two of the key land surface biophysical variables that control the land surface response of land surface schemes in climate models. Their representation is crucial for predicting transpiration (\&\#955;ET) and evaporation (\&\#955;EE) flux components of the terrestrial latent heat flux (\&\#955;E), which has important implications for global climate change and water resource management. By physical integration of radiometric surface temperature (TR) into an integrated framework of the Penman?Monteith and Shuttleworth?Wallace models, we present a novel approach to directly quantify the canopy-scale biophysical controls on \&\#955;ET and \&\#955;EE over multiple plant functional types (PFTs) in the Amazon Basin. Combining data from six LBA (Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia) eddy covariance tower sites and a TR-driven physically based modeling approach, we identified the canopy-scale feedback-response mechanism between gC, \&\#955;ET, and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (DA), without using any leaf-scale empirical parameterizations for the modeling. The TR-based model shows minor biophysical control on \&\#955;ET during the wet (rainy) seasons where \&\#955;ET becomes predominantly radiation driven and net radiation (RN) determines 75 to 80\&\#8239;\% of the variances of \&\#955;ET. However, biophysical control on \&\#955;ET is dramatically increased during the dry seasons, and particularly the 2005 drought year, explaining 50 to 65\&\#8239;\% of the variances of \&\#955;ET, and indicates \&\#955;ET to be substantially soil moisture driven during the rainfall deficit phase. Despite substantial differences in gA between forests and pastures, very similar canopy?atmosphere "coupling" was found in these two biomes due to soil moisture-induced decrease in gC in the pasture. This revealed the pragmatic aspect of the TR-driven model behavior that exhibits a high sensitivity of gC to per unit change in wetness as opposed to gA that is marginally sensitive to surface wetness variability. Our results reveal the occurrence of a significant hysteresis between \&\#955;ET and gC during the dry season for the pasture sites, which is attributed to relatively low soil water availability as compared to the rainforests, likely due to differences in rooting depth between the two systems. Evaporation was significantly influenced by gA for all the PFTs and across all wetness conditions. Our analytical framework logically captures the responses of gC and gA to changes in atmospheric radiation, DA, and surface radiometric temperature, and thus appears to be promising for the improvement of existing land?surface?atmosphere exchange parameterizations across a range of spatial scales.},

	abstract = {Plant transpiration is a key component of the terrestrial water cycle, and it is important to understand whether rates are likely to increase or decrease in the future. Plant transpiration rates are affected by biophysical factors, such as air temperature, vapour pressure deficits and net radiation, and by plant factors, such as canopy leaf area and stomatal conductance. Under future climate change, global temperature increases, and associated increases in vapour pressure deficits, will act to increase canopy transpiration rates. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, however, is likely to lead to some reduction in stomatal conductance, which will reduce canopy transpiration rates. The objective of the present paper was to quantitatively compare the importance of these opposing driving forces. First, we reviewed the existing literature and list a large range of observations of the extent of decreasing stomatal conductance with increasing CO2 concentrations. We considered observations ranging from short-term laboratory-based experiments with plants grown under different CO2 concentrations to studies of plants exposed to the naturally increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Using these empirical observations of plant responses, and a set of well-tested biophysical relationships, we then estimated the net effect of the opposing influences of warming and CO2 concentration on transpiration rates. As specific cases studies, we explored expected changes in greater detail for six specific representative locations, covering the range from tropical to boreal forests. For most locations investigated, we calculated reductions in daily transpiration rates over the twenty-first century that became stronger under higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. It showed that the effect of CO2-induced reduction of stomatal conductance would have a stronger transpiration-depressing effect than the stimulatory effect of future warming. For currently cold regions, global warming would, however, lengthen the growing seasons so that annual sums of transpiration could increase in those regions despite reductions in daily transpiration rates over the summer months.},

The high heat capacity of thick leaves can damp this rapid change in temperature. However, little is known about the extent to which increased leaf thickness can reduce thermal damage, or how thick leaves would need to be to have biological significance. We evaluated quantitatively the contribution of small increases in leaf thickness to the reduction in thermal damage during critically low wind speeds under desert conditions. • We employed a numerical model to investigate the effect of thickness relative to transpiration, absorptance and leaf size on damage avoidance. We used measured traits and thermotolerance thresholds of real leaves to calculate the leaf temperature response to naturally occurring variable low wind speed. • Our results demonstrated that an increase in thickness of only fractions of a millimetre can prevent excursions to damaging high temperatures. This damping effect of increased thickness was greatest when other means of reducing leaf temperature (transpiration, reflectance or reduced size) were lacking. • For perennial desert flora, we propose that increased leaf thickness is important in decreasing the incidence of extreme heat stress and, in some species, in enhancing long-term survival.},

When the air flow in the wind tunnel was laminar, the boundary layer was often turbulent at a wind speed of only 1.5 m s−1, particularly when encouraged by uneven topography and roughness of the surface, as on the lower side of the leaf. The smoother upper surface behaved in a similar way to a flat plate when at low wind speeds, and the profiles of wind speed could be shown to be equivalent to those expected from laminar boundary layer theory. Nevertheless, the boundary layer became turbulent at Reynolds numbers much lower than those required to cause the transition to turbulence in a flat plate. Turbulent air flow in the wind tunnel greatly increased boundary layer turbulence but had only a small effect on evaporation from a model of the leaf. The evaporation rates observed were 2.5 times higher than expected from theory, irrespective of the turbulence regime.},

Even short episodes of heat stress can reduce crop yield considerably causing low resource use efficiency. Studies on the impact of heat stress on crop yields over larger regions generally rely on temperatures measured by standard weather stations at 2 m height. Canopy temperatures measured in this study in field plots of rye were up to 7 °C higher than air temperature measured at typical weather station height with the differences in temperatures controlled by soil moisture contents. Relationships between heat stress and grain number derived from controlled environment studies were only confirmed under field conditions when canopy temperature was used to calculate stress thermal time. By using hourly mean temperatures measured by 78 weather stations located across Germany for the period 1994–2009 it is estimated, that mean yield declines in wheat due to heat stress during flowering were 0.7\% when temperatures are measured at 2 m height, but yield declines increase to 22\% for temperatures measured at the ground. These results suggest that canopy temperature should be simulated or estimated to reduce uncertainty in assessing heat stress impacts on crop yield.},

This should allow the extension of afforestation activities into drier regions. Using eddy flux, physiological and inventory measurements we provide the first quantitative information on such potential from a 35-year old afforestation system of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) at the edge of the Negev desert. This 2800 ha arid-land forest contains 6.5 ± 1.2 kg C m−2, and continues to accumulate 0.13–0.24 kg C m−2 yr−1. The CO2 uptake is highest during the winter, out of phase with most northern hemispheric forest activity. This seasonal offset offers low latitude forests ∼10 ppm higher CO2 concentrations than that available to higher latitude forests during the productive season, in addition to the 30\% increase in mean atmospheric CO2 concentrations since the 1850s. Expanding afforestation efforts into drier regions may be significant for C sequestration and associated benefits (restoration of degraded land, reducing runoff, erosion and soil compaction, improving wildlife) because of the large spatial scale of the regions potentially involved (ca. 2 × 109 ha of global shrub-land and C4 grassland).

No acclimation occurred under precipitation reduction: lower Gs and FD were found for both species compared to ambient conditions. Warming reduced the sensibility of stomata to VPD for both species but resulted in the maintenance of Gs and FD to ambient levels only for piñon. For juniper, reduced soil moisture under warming negated benefits of stomatal adjustments and resulted in reduced FD, Gs and KL. Although reduced stomatal sensitivity to VPD also occurred under combined stresses, reductions in Gs, FD and KL took place to similar levels as under single stresses for both species. Our results show that stomatal conductance adjustments to high VPD could minimize but not entirely prevent additive effects of warming and drying on water use and carbon acquisition of trees in semi-arid regions.},

	abstract = {Because eCO2 causes partial stomatal closure, transpiration from plant leaves is reduced, which has many ramifications for plant water relations, which can be summarized as follows: The reduction in leaf transpiration reduces evaporative cooling with a consequential rise in canopy temperatures. Increases of 0.3–1.7 °C at CO2 concentrations of 550 ppm (200 ppm above current concentrations) have been observed, depending on species and conditions. Such canopy temperature changes are likely to cause shifts in the optimum geographic climate areas for growth of crops and other species. The reduction in transpiration per unit of leaf area with eCO2 generally leads to a reduction in ET per unit of land area. However, the magnitude of such water conservation at eCO2 varies with the degree of stimulation of plant growth and the degree of partial stomatal closure. Observed reductions in ET have ranged from near zero for cotton, a woody C3 species with large growth stimulation, to about 16 {\textbackslash}\% for sorghum, a C4 grass with little growth stimulation. In the absence of global warming, such water conservation will reduce the water requirements of irrigated regions, and with global warming, it will help to keep the requirements from rising as much as the warming alone would cause. The reductions in ET with eCO2 will also lead to increases in soil moisture content, with consequent effects on numerous soil physical, chemical, and biological processes that are influenced by soil moisture content, such as leaching, mineralization, and soil respiration. The reductions in ET and consequent increases in soil moisture can lead to improvements in plant water relations, such as higher plant water potentials. Water conservation with growth in eCO2 can enable plants to maintain growth longer into drought cycles.},

Based on a 9-year study in the forests’ dry timberline, we show that substantial carbon sequestration (cooling effect) is maintained in the large dry transition zone (precipitation from 200 to 600 millimeters) by shifts in peak photosynthetic activities from summer to early spring, and this is counteracted by longwave radiation (L) suppression (warming effect), doubling the forestation shortwave (S) albedo effect. Several decades of carbon accumulation are required to balance the twofold S + L effect. Desertification over the past several decades, however, contributed negative forcing at Earth’s surface equivalent to {\textasciitilde}20\% of the global anthropogenic CO2 effect over the same period, moderating warming trends. Semi-arid forests could cool climate by sequestering CO2, but could also warm it by reducing Earth’s albedo.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF00545668},
	abstract = {The temperature and water relations of the largleafed, high-elevation species Frasera speciosa, Balsamorhiza sagittata, and Rumex densiflorus were evaluated in the Medicine Bow Mountains of southeast Wyoming (USA) to determine the influence of leaf size, orientation, and arrangement on transpiration. These species characteristically have low minimum stomatal resistances (\&lt;60 s m-1) and high maximum transpiration rates (\&gt;260 mg m-2s-1 for F. speciosa). Field measurements of leaf and microclimatic parameters were incorporated into a computer simulation using standard energy balance equations which predicted leaf temperature (Tleaf) and transpiration for various leaf sizes. Whole-plant transpiration during a day was simulated using field measurements for plants with natural leaf sizes and compared to transpiration rates simulated for plants having identical, but hypothetically smaller (0.5 cm) leaves during a clear day and a typically cloudy day. Although clear-day transpiration for F. speciosa plants with natural size leaves was only 2.0\% less per unit leaf area than that predicted for plants with much smaller leaves, daily transpiration of B. sagittata and R. densiflorus plants with natural leaf sizes was 16.1\% and 21.1\% less, respectively. The predicted influence of a larger leaf size on transpiration for the cloudy day was similar to clear-day results except that F. speciosa had much greater decreases in transpiration (12.7\%). The different influences of leaf size on transpiration between the three species was primarily due to major differences in leaf absorptance to solar radiation, orientation, and arrangement which caused large differences in Tleaf. Also, simulated increases in leaf size above natural sizes measured in the field resulted in only small additional decreases in predicted transpiration, indicating a leaf size that was nearly optimal for reducing transpiration. These results are discussed in terms of the possible evolution of a larger leaf size in combination with specific leaf absorptances, orientations and arrangements which could act to reduce transpiration for species growing in short-season habitats where the requirement for rapid carbon fixation might necessitate low stomatal resistances. © 1982 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The size of leaves typical for specific climates has been studied for many years, and several investigators have considered the “leaf size class” as an indicator of climatic conditions (Raunkiaer, 1934). Bailey and Sinnott (1916) concluded that the form and size of leaves were more a result of environment than of genetic history, although the latter was certainly an influence. Benson et al. (1967) reported ecotypic differentiation of leaf form with respect to slope exposure for a hybrid population of Quercus douglassii × Q. turbinella. They suggested that hybrid variability may permit the rapid evolutionary selection of characters best suited for the particular microclimate. They reported that individuals found on the northeast slope had leaves of significantly larger dimension than did those growing on the more arid southwest slope (Fig. 5.1). It is generally considered that the reduction of leaf size in arid areas has the effect of conserving water, but quantitative evidence of the effects of leaf size has been available only recently.},

The great majority of applications of thermography and of infrared thermometry depend on the sensitivity of leaf temperature to evaporation rate (and hence to stomatal aperture). In most applications, such as in the early or pre-symptomatic detection of disease or water deficits, what is actually being studied is the effect of the disease on stomatal behaviour or membrane permeability to water. Other applications of thermography in plant physiology include the study of thermogenesis as well as the characterisation of boundary layer transfer processes. Thermography is shown to be more than just a method for obtaining pretty pictures; it has particular advantages for the quantitative analysis of spatial and dynamic physiological information. Its capacity for large throughput has found application in screening approaches, such as in the selection of stomatal or hormonal mutants. The use of wet and dry reference surfaces for the enhancement of the power of thermal imaging approaches, especially in the field is reviewed, and the problems and potential solutions when applying thermography in the field and in the laboratory discussed.},

Desert cactus with large photosynthetic stem surfaces had the highest temperatures and lowest transpiration rates. Perennial plants with relatively small leaves had moderate transpiration rates and leaf temperatures close to air temperature. Desert perennials with relatively large leaves had leaf temperatures well below air temperature along with the greatest accompanying transpiration rates of over 20 micrograms per square centimeter per second, but also had correspondingly low temperatures for maximum photosynthesis. The low leaf temperatures measured for these large-leafed species are an exception to the more common pattern for desert plants whereby a smaller leaf size prevents overheating and leads to reductions in transpiration and increased water-use efficiency. The contribution of a larger leaf size to a lower leaf temperature, and thus higher rate of photosynthesis for these large-leafed species, may represent an adaptive pattern previously unrecognized for desert plants.},

	abstract = {Drought-induced mortality and regional dieback of woody vegetation are reported from numerous locations around the world. Yet within any one site, predicting which species are most likely to survive global change-type drought is a challenge. We studied the diversity of drought survival traits of a community of 15 woody plant species in a desert-chaparral ecotone. The vegetation was a mix of chaparral and desert shrubs, as well as endemic species that only occur along this margin. This vegetation boundary has large potential for drought-induced mortality because nearly all species are at the edge of their range. Drought survival traits studied were vulnerability to drought-induced xylem cavitation, sapwood capacitance, deciduousness, photosynthetic stems, deep roots, photosynthetic responses to leaf water potential and hydraulic architecture. Drought survival strategies were evaluated as combinations of traits that could be effective in dealing with drought. The large variation in seasonal predawn water potential of leaves and stem xylem ranged from −6·82 to −0·29 MPa and −6·92 to −0·27 MPa, respectively. The water potential at which photosynthesis ceases ranged from −9·42 to −3·44 MPa. Architecture was a determinant of hydraulic traits, with species supporting large leaf area per sapwood area exhibiting high rates of water transport, but also xylem that is vulnerable to drought-induced cavitation. Species with more negative midday leaf water potential during the growing season also showed access to deeper water sources based on hydrogen isotope analysis. Drought survival mechanisms comprised of drought deciduousness, photosynthetic stems, tolerance of low minimum seasonal tissue water potential and vulnerability to drought-induced xylem cavitation thus varied orthogonally among species, and promote a diverse array of drought survival strategies in an arid ecosystem of considerable floristic complexity.},

Once heated, the rate at which a material transfers the absorbed heat into the surroundings is determined by the thermal effusivity (or thermal inertia) of the material, and it depends on the well-known thermal properties, thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity. Since a direct measurement of these properties is rather difficult for thin biological specimens such as plant leaves, a photothermal technique is used to measure the thermal effusivity, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and specific heat capacity for a few representative species of plant leaves. Measurements have been carried out on fresh as well as dry leaves to estimate the differences in their properties. Thermal properties of plant leaves are compared with the corresponding properties of two materials abundant in the environment and discussed. The influence of thermal properties, particularly the thermal effusivity and specific heat capacity, of plant leaves on controlling the temperature of the environment around them is discussed.},

Mass loss, soil matric tension, and meteorological measurements, carried out in a climate-controlled laboratory, were used to study the effect of ambient conditions on the drying rates of a porous medium. A set of evaporation experiments from initially saturated sand columns were carried out under constant Ta of 6, 15, 25, and 35°C and related RH (0.66, 0.83, 1.08, and 1.41 kPa, respectively). The results show that the expected increase of the stage 1 (S1) evaporation rate with Ta but also revealed an exponential-like reduction in the duration of S1, which decreased from 29 to 2.3 days (at Ta of 6 and 35°C, respectively). The evaporation rate, e(t), was equal to the potential evaporation, ep(t), under Ta = 6°C, while it was always smaller than ep(t) under higher Ta. The cumulative evaporation during S1 was higher under Ta = 6°C than under the higher temperatures. Evaporation rates during S2 were practically unaffected by ambient conditions. The results were analyzed using a mass transfer formulation linking e(t) with the vapor pressure deficit through a resistance coefficient r. It was shown that rS1 (the resistance during S1) is constant, indicating that the application of such an approach is straightforward during S1. However, for evaporation from a free water surface and S2, the resistances, rBL and rS2, were temperature-dependent, introducing some complexity for these cases.},

Together the changes in long- and short-wave irradiances at Armagh accounted for more than three quarters of the interannual variations in mean annual temperatures.

These non-forest trees have a crucial role in biodiversity, and provide ecosystem services such as carbon storage, food resources and shelter for humans and animals1,2. However, most public interest relating to trees is devoted to forests, and trees outside of forests are not well-documented3. Here we map the crown size of each tree more than 3 m2 in size over a land area that spans 1.3 million km2 in the West African Sahara, Sahel and sub-humid zone, using submetre-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning4. We detected over 1.8 billion individual trees (13.4 trees per hectare), with a median crown size of 12 m2, along a rainfall gradient from 0 to 1,000 mm per year. The canopy cover increases from 0.1\% (0.7 trees per hectare) in hyper-arid areas, through 1.6\% (9.9 trees per hectare) in arid and 5.6\% (30.1 trees per hectare) in semi-arid zones, to 13.3\% (47 trees per hectare) in sub-humid areas. Although the overall canopy cover is low, the relatively high density of isolated trees challenges prevailing narratives about dryland desertification5–7, and even the desert shows a surprisingly high tree density. Our assessment suggests a way to monitor trees outside of forests globally, and to explore their role in mitigating degradation, climate change and poverty.},

	abstract = {Background Infrared thermal image scanners (ITIS) appear an attractive option for the mass screening of travellers for influenza, but there are no published data on their performance in airports. Methods ITIS was used to measure cutaneous temperature in 1275 airline travellers who had agreed to tympanic temperature measurement and respiratory sampling. The prediction by ITIS of tympanic temperature (37.8°C and 37.5°C) and of influenza infection was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and estimated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV). Findings Using front of face ITIS for prediction of tympanic temperature ≥37.8°C, the area under the ROC curve was 0.86 (95\%CI 0.75–0.97) and setting sensitivity at 86\% gave specificity of 71\%. The PPV in this population of travellers, of whom 0.5\% were febrile using this definition, was 1.5\%. We identified influenza virus infection in 30 travellers (3 Type A and 27 Type B). For ITIS prediction of influenza infection the area under the ROC curve was 0.66 (0.56–0.75), a sensitivity of 87\% gave specificity of 39\%, and PPV of 2.8\%. None of the 30 influenza-positive travellers had tympanic temperature ≥37.8°C at screening (95\%CI 0\% to 12\%); three had no influenza symptoms. Conclusion ITIS performed moderately well in detecting fever but in this study, during a seasonal epidemic of predominantly influenza type B, the proportion of influenza-infected travellers who were febrile was low and ITIS were not much better than chance at identifying travellers likely to be influenza-infected. Although febrile illness is more common in influenza A infections than influenza B infections, many influenza A infections are afebrile. Our findings therefore suggest that ITIS is unlikely to be effective for entry screening of travellers to detect influenza infection with the intention of preventing entry of the virus into a country.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Fever screening systems, such as Infrared Thermal Detection Systems (ITDS), have been used for rapid identification of potential cases during respiratory disease outbreaks for public health management. ITDS detect a difference between the subject and ambient temperature, making deployment in hot climates more challenging. This study, conducted in Singapore, a tropical city, evaluates the accuracy of three different ITDS for fever detection compared with traditional oral thermometry and self-reporting in a clinical setting.
Study design
This study is a prospective operational evaluation conducted in the Singapore military on all personnel seeking medical care at a high-volume primary healthcare centre over a one week period in February 2014.
Methods
Three ITDS, the STE Infrared Fever Screening System (IFSS), the Omnisense Sentry MKIII and the handheld Quick Shot Infrared Thermoscope HT-F03B, were evaluated. Temperature measurements were taken outside the healthcare centre, under a sheltered walkway and compared to oral temperature. Subjects were asked if they had fever.
Results
There were 430 subjects screened, of whom 34 participants (7.9\%) had confirmed fever, determined by oral thermometer measurement. The handheld infrared thermoscope had a very low sensitivity (29.4\%), but a high specificity (96.8\%). The STE ITDS had a moderate sensitivity (44.1\%), but a very high specificity (99.1\%). Self-reported fevers showed good sensitivity (88.2\%) and specificity (93.9\%). The sensitivity of the Omnisense ITDS (89.7\%) was the highest among the three methods with good specificity (92.0\%).
Conclusion
The new generation Omnisense ITDS displayed a relatively high sensitivity and specificity for fever. Though it has a lower sensitivity, the old generation STE ITDS system showed a very high specificity. Self-reporting of fever was reliable. The handheld thermograph should not be used as a fever-screening tool under tropical conditions.},

	abstract = {Several countries plan to introduce non-contact infrared thermometers (NCIT) at international airports in order to detect febrile passengers, thus to delay the introduction of a novel influenza strain. We reviewed the existing studies on fever screening by NCIT to estimate their efficacy under the hypothesis of pandemic influenza. Three Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or dengue fever interventions in airports were excluded because of insufficient information. Six fever screening studies in other gathering areas, mainly hospitals, were included (N= 176 to 72,327 persons; fever prevalence= 1.2\% to 16.9\%). Sensitivity varied from 4.0\% to 89.6\%, specificity from 75.4\% to 99.6\%, positive predictive value (PPV) from 0.9\% to 76.0\% and negative predictive value (NPV) from 86.1\% to 99.7\%. When we fixed fever prevalence at 1\% in all studies to allow comparisons, the derived PPV varied from 3.5\% to 65.4\% and NPV was \&gt;=99\%. The low PPV suggests limited efficacy of NCIT to detect symptomatic passengers at the early stages of a pandemic influenza, when fever prevalence among passengers would be =\&lt;1\%. External factors can also impair the screening strategy: passengers can hide their symptoms or cross borders before symptoms occur. These limits should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression.},

Here, we estimate the impact of different screening programs given current knowledge of key COVID-19 life history and epidemiological parameters. Even under best-case assumptions, we estimate that screening will miss more than half of infected people. Breaking down the factors leading to screening successes and failures, we find that most cases missed by screening are fundamentally undetectable, because they have not yet developed symptoms and are unaware they were exposed. Our work underscores the need for measures to limit transmission by individuals who become ill after being missed by a screening program. These findings can support evidence-based policy to combat the spread of COVID-19, and prospective planning to mitigate future emerging pathogens.},

The usefulness of thermography for mass screening has been evaluated in many recent studies; its sensitivity varies from 40 to 89.4\% under various circumstances. In this chapter, we perform IRT evaluations for detecting febrile international travelers entering Japan at Nagoya Airport, immediately after the SARS epidemic, from June 2003 to February 2004, and at Naha International Airport from April 2005 to March 2009. The correlation of body surface temperature measured via thermography with the axillary temperature was significant. Through IRT, febrile individuals were detected with good accuracy and the detection accuracy was improved by corroborating surveillance with self-reporting questionnaires . However, there are several limitations associated with the use of IRT for fever screening. For instance, taking antifebrile medications results in rapid modification of the body temperature and directly affects the efficiency of IRT. To solve this unreliability and obtain higher accuracy in mass screening, we have developed a novel infection screening system using multisensor data , i.e., heart and respiration rates are determined by microwave radar in noncontact manner and facial skin temperature is monitored through IRT. The detection accuracy of the system improved, which is notably higher compared to the conventional screening method using only IRT.},

Here, this issue is explored experimentally and analytically in three adjacent ecosystems (a grass-covered old-field, OF, a planted pine forest, PP, and a hardwood forest, HW) representing a successional chronosequence in the SE. The results showed that changes in albedo alone can warm the surface by 0.9°C for the OF-to-PP conversion, and 0.7°C for the OF-to-HW conversion on annual time scales. However, changes in eco-physiological and aerodynamic attributes alone can cool the surface by 2.9 and 2.1°C, respectively. Both model and measurements consistently suggest a stronger over-all surface cooling for the OF-to-PP conversion, and the reason is attributed to leaf area variations and its impacts on boundary layer conductance.},

We find that restoring 15\% of converted lands in priority areas could avoid 60\% of expected extinctions while sequestering 299 gigatonnes of CO2—30\% of the total CO2 increase in the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. The inclusion of several biomes is key to achieving multiple benefits. Cost effectiveness can increase up to 13-fold when spatial allocation is optimized using our multicriteria approach, which highlights the importance of spatial planning. Our results confirm the vast potential contributions of restoration to addressing global challenges, while underscoring the necessity of pursuing these goals synergistically.},

	abstract = {Projected intensification of drying and warming trends imply severe 
risks for widespread forest mortality. Drought adapted trees in semiarid
ecosystems cope with both soil water shortage and high vapor pressure
deficit by regulating their leaf conductance, avoiding irreversible
hydraulic failure, and maintaining CO2 uptake.    To better understand
the relative effects of soil vs. atmospheric moisture deficit on tree
response we carried out a manipulation experiment in a semi-arid Aleppo
pine forest exposed to long seasonal drought (the Yatir forest; 280 mm
mean annual precipitation). We provided supplementary irrigation to
eliminate summer soil moisture deficit in 1 ha plot with similar
adjacent control plot. We investigated the tree response to the
supplement irrigation with automatic branch chambers (16 chambers split
in treatment and control plots), sap flow sensors (SF; 40 trees) and
electronic dendrometers (20 trees) sensors.    Results from the first
treatment year showed a drought-typical decline in branch net
assimilation (An) and transpiration (T) in early summer (from ˜15
to ˜4 g C m-2h-1 and from 2 to 0.5 mm h-1, respectively in midday
values). However, upon the onset of the supplement irrigation in May, T
increased dramatically to ˜5 mm h-1, ˜2.5 times higher than
the peak wet season values. This increase was in correlation with the
seasonal increase in VPD to {\textgreater}5 kPa in June. This was accompanied by a
large parallel increase in stem diameter, by ˜4.5 mm on average
from May to June in the treated plot, with no increase in the control
plot. This must at least partly reflect increase in tree water storage
to support the large transpiration flux, and large mid-day SF that
increased x2 in the treatment plots. Net assimilation in the treated
plot also increased, from ˜15 to 20 g C m-2 h-1 ˜1.3 times
higher than the wet season values.    We will discuss the interplay
between soil moisture control and VPD as rate regulation of T across the
large range observed in this study (up to VPD of 7 kPa); and the
unexpectedly high flexibility in adjusting internal water storage to
support large increase in T and in the synchronization between the
timing of T and SF. The enhancement in An, could be the response to
increased stomatal conductance in the treatment plot, and the seasonal
increase in temperature and light levels.    The results indicate that
growth of Aleppo pine at the dry timberline is clearly limited by water
availability and that VPD plays a subordinated role. However, tree
mortality may also be avoided by the opportunistic and fast response
behavior to any improvement in conditions even in the stressful dry
season.},

This paradox suggests the existence of efficient non-evaporative heat removal mechanisms that protect the biological functioning of dry forest ecosystems: Turbulence. 
We quantify the production of sensible heat within the forest canopy and show the efficiency of sensible heat removal through the contribution of the two main TKE production terms, buoyancy and mechanical shear, within the tree canopies as an efficient non-evaporative cooling mechanism.},

	url = {https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2019/EGU2019-16971.pdf},
	abstract = {Due to their wide global distribution ({\textasciitilde}18\% of land area), semi-arid regions play an important role in the climate system. Forests in this zone are characterized by high radiation exposure, low albedo, and limited evaporative cooling, all of which can greatly affect canopy temperature. This, in turn, can negatively influence biological processes such as photosynthesis and plant water stress through increased transpiration. Therefore, under these conditions, control over leaf temperature and any cooling processes must rely on the sensible heat flux (ultimately resulting in a canopy convector effect; Rotenberg \& Yakir, 2010). In this project, we assess the effect of summer drought on needle temperature in a water-limited semi-arid pine forest in control and summer-irrigated plots in our semi-arid research site in southern Israel. We employed a specially built system using a high-resolution infrared camera combined with a reference surface for high accuracy, continuous leaf-scale measurements of temperature and background thermal radiation, along with simultaneous air temperature measurements. This setup was deployed consecutively in the control and irrigated plots during the seasonal summer drought period using a portable mast within the canopy.
First results from our newly developed system indicated that correcting for background thermal radiation reduced the discrepancy between infrared and thermocouple-based leaf temperature from {\textasciitilde}2°C to {\textasciitilde}0.5°C. Based on this novel approach we found that at night, pine needles cool down to near air temperature. During the dry midday, when evapotranspiration was minimal, leaf temperature remained within 1-2°C of air temperature, which was {\textgreater}30°C. This is surprising in light of observations of leaf temperature 2-3°C higher than air temperature in fully irrigated, high transpiration broad-leaf trees in similar climatic conditions (Cohen et al. 1997). Furthermore, comparing needle temperature in the control and irrigated plots in our forest showed that when exposed to sunlight leaf temperature was similar (within 1°C) in both plots in spite of a x10 higher transpiration rate in the irrigated plot. When shaded, needle temperature in the irrigated plot adjusted to air temperature within {\textasciitilde}1h while needles in the control (drought) plot remained {\textasciitilde}1-2°C above it.
These results suggest an effective coupling between leaf and air in our semi-arid pine forest, which prevents overheating and may explain the observed resistance of these trees to the harsh conditions.  Furthermore, the results suggest some decoupling between needle temperature and transpiration in our ecosystem. This, in turn, may be inconsistent with the prediction of a large increase in leaf temperature associated with higher future atmospheric CO2 levels that would lead to stomatal closure and reduced transpiration.},

	abstract = {The potential for global forest cover
The restoration of forested land at a global scale could help capture atmospheric carbon and mitigate climate change. Bastin et al. used direct measurements of forest cover to generate a model of forest restoration potential across the globe (see the Perspective by Chazdon and Brancalion). Their spatially explicit maps show how much additional tree cover could exist outside of existing forests and agricultural and urban land. Ecosystems could support an additional 0.9 billion hectares of continuous forest. This would represent a greater than 25\% increase in forested area, including more than 200 gigatonnes of additional carbon at maturity.Such a change has the potential to store an equivalent of 25\% of the current atmospheric carbon pool.
Science, this issue p. 76; see also p. 24
The restoration of trees remains among the most effective strategies for climate change mitigation. We mapped the global potential tree coverage to show that 4.4 billion hectares of canopy cover could exist under the current climate. Excluding existing trees and agricultural and urban areas, we found that there is room for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of canopy cover, which could store 205 gigatonnes of carbon in areas that would naturally support woodlands and forests. This highlights global tree restoration as one of the most effective carbon drawdown solutions to date. However, climate change will alter this potential tree coverage. We estimate that if we cannot deviate from the current trajectory, the global potential canopy cover may shrink by {\textasciitilde}223 million hectares by 2050, with the vast majority of losses occurring in the tropics. Our results highlight the opportunity of climate change mitigation through global tree restoration but also the urgent need for action.
There is room on the planet for an extra 0.9 billion hectares of tree cover, supporting 517 billion trees and storing 205 Gt of carbon.

	abstract = {The influence of soil water content in thermal infrared emissivity is a known fact but has been poorly studied in the past. A laboratory study for quantifying the dependence of emissivity on soil moisture was carried out. Six samples of surface horizons of different soil types were selected for the experiment. The gravimetric method was chosen for determining the soil moisture, whereas the emissivity was measured at different soil water contents using the two-lid variant of the box method. As a result, the study showed that emissivity increases from 1.7\% to 16\% when water content becomes higher, especially in sandy soils in the 8.2–9.2 μm range. Accordingly, a set of equations was derived to obtain emissivity from soil moisture at different spectral bands for the analyzed mineral soils. Moreover, results showed that the spectral ratio decreases with increasing soil water content. Finally, the study showed that systematic errors from 0.1 to 2 K can be caused by soil moisture influence on emissivity.},

The authors attempted to determine whether the emissivity can be neglected or not in situations of topical application of substances such as ultrasound gel, ointment, disinfection, etc. The results of experiments showed that the value of surface temperature is more or less distorted by the topically applied substance. Our findings demonstrate the effect of emissivity of applied substances on resulting temperature and showed the necessity to integrate the emissivity into calculation of the final surface temperature. Infrared thermoimaging can be an appropriate method for determining the temperature of organisms, if this is understood as the surface temperature, and the surrounding environment and its temperature is taken into account.},

	abstract = {Understanding forest tree responses to climate warming and heatwaves is important for predicting changes in tree species diversity, forest C uptake, and vegetation–climate interactions. Yet, tree species differences in heatwave tolerance and their plasticity to growth temperature remain poorly understood. In this study, populations of four Eucalyptus species, two with large range sizes and two with comparatively small range sizes, were grown under two temperature treatments (cool and warm) before being exposed to an equivalent experimental heatwave. We tested whether the species with large and small range sizes differed in heatwave tolerance, and whether trees grown under warmer temperatures were more tolerant of heatwave conditions than trees grown under cooler temperatures. Visible heatwave damage was more common and severe in the species with small rather than large range sizes. In general, species that showed less tissue damage maintained higher stomatal conductance, lower leaf temperatures, larger increases in isoprene emissions, and less photosynthetic inhibition than species that showed more damage. Species exhibiting more severe visible damage had larger increases in heat shock proteins (HSPs) and respiratory thermotolerance (Tmax). Thus, across species, increases in HSPs and Tmax were positively correlated, but inversely related to increases in isoprene emissions. Integration of leaf gas-exchange, isoprene emissions, proteomics, and respiratory thermotolerance measurements provided new insight into mechanisms underlying variability in tree species heatwave tolerance. Importantly, warm-grown seedlings were, surprisingly, more susceptible to heatwave damage than cool-grown seedlings, which could be associated with reduced enzyme concentrations in leaves. We conclude that species with restricted range sizes, along with trees growing under climate warming, may be more vulnerable to heatwaves of the future.},

	abstract = {The temperature response of photosynthesis is one of the key factors determining predicted responses to warming in global vegetation models (GVMs). The response may vary geographically, owing to genetic adaptation to climate, and temporally, as a result of acclimation to changes in ambient temperature. Our goal was to develop a robust quantitative global model representing acclimation and adaptation of photosynthetic temperature responses. We quantified and modelled key mechanisms responsible for photosynthetic temperature acclimation and adaptation using a global dataset of photosynthetic CO2 response curves, including data from 141 C3 species from tropical rainforest to Arctic tundra. We separated temperature acclimation and adaptation processes by considering seasonal and common-garden datasets, respectively. The observed global variation in the temperature optimum of photosynthesis was primarily explained by biochemical limitations to photosynthesis, rather than stomatal conductance or respiration. We found acclimation to growth temperature to be a stronger driver of this variation than adaptation to temperature at climate of origin. We developed a summary model to represent photosynthetic temperature responses and showed that it predicted the observed global variation in optimal temperatures with high accuracy. This novel algorithm should enable improved prediction of the function of global ecosystems in a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Trees are essential in a dense urban environment not only because of their aesthetic value, but also for their cooling effect during hot periods, which impacts directly on the local microclimate. However, certain trees cope better with high urban temperatures than others. Here, we report tree crown temperatures of 10 common tree species frequently planted in Central European cities (in part, supplemented with stomatal conductance data, gs). Parts of the city of Basel, Switzerland (7°41′E/47 °34′N) were scanned from a helicopter using a high-resolution thermal camera. A histogram of the composite image shows peaks at 18°C (water), 26°C (vegetation), 37°C (streets) and a less obvious one at 45°C (roofs). At an ambient temperature of c. 25°C, tree crown temperatures ranged from c. 24°C (Aesculus hippocastanum trees located in a park) to 29°C in Acer platanoides trees, located in a street. Trees in parks were significantly cooler (c. 26°C) than trees surrounded by sealed ground (c. 27°C). The only coniferous species, Pinus sylvestris did not vary in temperature with location (park or street) and exhibited foliage temperature close to air temperature. Generally, small-leaved trees remained cooler than large-leaved trees. Stomatal conductance data collected during similar weather conditions suggest that there was no bias in crown temperatures due to locally different water supply between trees. Although the highest leaf temperatures of individuals of A. platanoides reached over 5K leaf-to-air temperature difference (ΔTL−A), we do not expect temperature stress to occur in these conditions. In order to estimate possible effects of future temperature extremes on ΔTL−A, we evaluated the leaf energy balance for a range of stomatal responses and air temperatures, using leaf size, wind speed and the measured species-specific leaf boundary layer resistance. At an ambient temperature of 40°C, ΔTL−A ranged from 2 to 5K when gs was assumed to drop linearly to 50\% of its maximum value. When gs was compromised further (20\% of species-specific maxima), the difference in ΔTL−A between species became larger with rising ambient temperature (range 4–10K). Those species with the lowest leaf temperatures at 25°C were not necessarily coolest at 40°C. Species-specific differences in ΔTL−A under extreme temperatures as shown here may be useful for urban tree planning in order to optimise management cost and human comfort.},

	abstract = {Forests are structurally complex ecosystems with several canopy layers, each with distinct functional properties contributing differently to the net ecosystem CO2 exchange. A large number of studies have addressed ecosystem-scale net CO2 fluxes in forests, but only few studies have investigated the role of the forest understory. The goal of this study was to quantify the below-canopy contribution to ecosystem CO2 fluxes of a mixed deciduous forest in Switzerland. Below- and above-canopy eddy-covariance (EC) measurements were made continuously over two years, complemented by within canopy wind and CO2 concentration profile measurements. On an annual basis, the below-canopy fluxes indicated a net carbon source dominated by soil respiration, while the above-canopy fluxes were dominated by tree photosynthesis leading to a net carbon sink. Below-canopy fluxes showed a net carbon sink only in spring, with the early emergence of understory plants before overstory canopy leaf-out. Below-canopy respiration partitioned from the EC measurements agreed well with previous chamber-based soil respiration measurements. However, below- and above-canopy fluxes became decoupled under full canopy closure, thus leading to unaccounted below-canopy fluxes when measured only above the canopy. Wind and CO2 concentration profile measurements supported this finding. Decoupling was independent of low turbulence conditions and decoupled periods could be identified using the relationship between the below- and above-canopy standard deviation in vertical wind velocity. A decoupling correction was applied to the above-canopy measurements during decoupled periods and corrected annual net ecosystem production (NEP) agreed well with independent estimates from biomass inventory combined with models. Overall, the below-canopy fluxes contributed 79\% to annual ecosystem respiration, but only 9\% to annual ecosystem photosynthesis. The decoupling correction reduced annual NEP for the site from about 760 to 330gCm−2yr−1. Our results showed that below-canopy EC measurements are essential in this mixed deciduous forest, and likely in many other forests, to fully understand the carbon dynamics within structurally complex ecosystems.},

Here, we show the response of canopy photosynthesis to different fractions of diffuse light conditions for five major arable crops (pea, potato, wheat, barley, rapeseed) and cover crops characterized by different canopy architecture. We used 13 years of flux and microclimate measurements over a field with a typical four-year crop rotation scheme in Switzerland. We investigated the effect of diffuse light on photosynthesis over a gradient of diffuse light fractions ranging from 100\% diffuse (overcast sky) to 11\% diffuse light (clear-sky conditions). Gross primary productivity increased with diffuse fraction and thus was greater under diffuse than direct light conditions if the absolute photon flux density per unit surface area was kept constant. Mean leaf tilt angle (MTA) and canopy height were found to be the best predictors of the diffuse vs. direct radiation effect on photosynthesis. Climatic factors, such as the drought index and growing degree days (GDD), had a significant influence on initial quantum yield under direct but not diffuse light conditions, which depended primarily on MTA. The maximum photosynthetic rate at 2000 µmol m–2 s–1 PAR under direct conditions strongly depended on GDD, MTA, leaf area index (LAI), and the interaction between MTA and LAI, while under diffuse conditions this parameter depended mostly on MTA and only to a minor extent on canopy height and their interaction. The strongest photosynthesis enhancement under diffuse light was found for wheat, barley and rapeseed, whereas the lowest was for pea. Thus, we suggest that measuring canopy architecture and diffuse radiation will greatly improve gross primary productivity estimates of global cropping systems.},

Here, we evaluated canopy temperature in a rubber plantation (RP) and tropical rainforest (TR) in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. An infrared temperature sensor was installed at each site to measure canopy temperature. In the dry season, the maximum differences (Tc − Ta) between canopy temperature (Tc) and air temperature (Ta) in the RP and TR were 2.6 and 0.1 K, respectively. In the rainy season, the maximum (Tc − Ta) values in the RP and TR were 1.0 and −1.1 K, respectively. There were consistent differences between the two forests, with the RP having higher (Tc − Ta) than the TR throughout the entire year. Infrared measurements of Tc can be used to calculate canopy stomatal conductance in both forests. The difference in (Tc − Ta) at three gc levels with increasing direct radiation in the RP was larger than in the TR, indicating that change in (Tc − Ta) in the RP was relatively sensitive to the degree of stomatal closure.},

However, deriving accurate temperature data from these cameras is non-trivialsince they are highly sensitive to changes in their internal temperature and low-cost models are often not radiometrically calibrated. We present the results of laboratory and field experiments that tested the extent of the temperature-dependency of a non-radiometric FLIR Vue Pro 640. We found that a simple empirical line calibration using at least three ground calibration points was sufficient to convert camera digital numbers to temperature values for images captured during UAV flight. Although the camera performed well under stable laboratory conditions (accuracy ±0.5 °C), the accuracy declined to ±5 °C under the changing ambient conditions experienced during UAV flight. The poor performance resulted from the non-linear relationship between camera output and sensor temperature, which was affected by wind and temperature-drift during flight. The camera’s automated non-uniformity correction (NUC) could not sufficiently correct for these effects. Prominent vignetting was also visible in images captured under both stable and changing ambient conditions. The inconsistencies in camera output over time and across the sensor will affect camera applications based on relative temperature differences as well as user-generated radiometric calibration. Based on our findings, we present a set of best practices for UAV TIR camera sampling to minimize the impacts of the temperature dependency of these systems.},

	abstract = {Drylands make up roughly 40\% of the Earth's land surface, and billions of people depend on services provided by these critically important ecosystems. Despite their relatively sparse vegetation, dryland ecosystems are structurally and functionally diverse, and emerging evidence suggests that these ecosystems play a dominant role in the trend and variability of the terrestrial carbon sink. More, drylands are highly sensitive to climate and are likely to have large, non-linear responses to hydroclimatic change. Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of dryland ecosystem structure (e.g., leaf area index) and function (e.g., primary production and evapotranspiration) is therefore a high research priority. Yet, dryland remote sensing is defined by unique challenges not typically encountered in mesic or humid regions. Major challenges include low vegetation signal-to-noise ratios, high soil background reflectance, presence of photosynthetic soils (i.e., biological soil crusts), high spatial heterogeneity from plot to regional scales, and irregular growing seasons due to unpredictable seasonal rainfall and frequent periods of drought. Additionally, there is a relative paucity of continuous, long-term measurements in drylands, which impedes robust calibration and evaluation of remotely-sensed dryland data products. Due to these issues, remote sensing techniques developed in other ecosystems or for global application often result in inaccurate, poorly constrained estimates of dryland ecosystem structural and functional dynamics. Here, we review past achievements and current progress in remote sensing of dryland ecosystems, including a detailed discussion of the major challenges associated with remote sensing of key dryland structural and functional dynamics. We then identify strategies aimed at leveraging new and emerging opportunities in remote sensing to overcome previous challenges and more accurately contextualize drylands within the broader Earth system. Specifically, we recommend: 1) Exploring novel combinations of sensors and techniques (e.g., solar-induced fluorescence, thermal, microwave, hyperspectral, and LiDAR) across a range of spatiotemporal scales to gain new insights into dryland structural and functional dynamics; 2) utilizing near-continuous observations from new-and-improved geostationary satellites to capture the rapid responses of dryland ecosystems to diurnal variation in water stress; 3) expanding ground observational networks to better represent the heterogeneity of dryland systems and enable robust calibration and evaluation; 4) developing algorithms that are specifically tuned to dryland ecosystems by utilizing expanded ground observational network data; and 5) coupling remote sensing observations with process-based models using data assimilation to improve mechanistic understanding of dryland ecosystem dynamics and to better constrain ecological forecasts and long-term projections.},

Early estimation of yield at field or plot scale also contributes to high-throughput plant phenotyping and precision agriculture. New developments in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms and sensor technology facilitate cost-effective data collection through simultaneous multi-sensor/multimodal data collection at very high spatial and spectral resolutions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the power of UAV-based multimodal data fusion using RGB, multispectral and thermal sensors to estimate soybean (Glycine max) grain yield within the framework of Deep Neural Network (DNN). RGB, multispectral, and thermal images were collected using a low-cost multi-sensory UAV from a test site in Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multimodal information, such as canopy spectral, structure, thermal and texture features, was extracted and combined to predict crop grain yield using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), input-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F1) and intermediate-level feature fusion based DNN (DNN-F2). The results can be summarized in three messages: (1) multimodal data fusion improves the yield prediction accuracy and is more adaptable to spatial variations; (2) DNN-based models improve yield prediction model accuracy: the highest accuracy was obtained by DNN-F2 with an R2 of 0.720 and a relative root mean square error (RMSE\%) of 15.9\%; (3) DNN-based models were less prone to saturation effects, and exhibited more adaptive performance in predicting grain yields across the Dwight, Pana and AG3432 soybean genotypes in our study. Furthermore, DNN-based models demonstrated consistent performance over space with less spatial dependency and variations. This study indicates that multimodal data fusion using low-cost UAV within a DNN framework can provide a relatively accurate and robust estimation of crop yield, and deliver valuable insight for high-throughput phenotyping and crop field management with high spatial precision.},

	abstract = {Thermal infrared cameras provide unique information on surface temperature that can benefit a range of environmental, industrial and agricultural applications. However, the use of uncooled thermal cameras for field and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based data collection is often hampered by vignette effects, sensor drift, ambient temperature influences and measurement bias. Here, we develop and apply an ambient temperature‐dependent radiometric calibration function that is evaluated against three thermal infrared sensors (Apogee SI‐11(Apogee Electronics, Santa Monica, CA, USA), FLIR A655sc (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA), TeAx 640 (TeAx Technology, Wilnsdorf, Germany)). Upon calibration, all systems demonstrated significant improvement in measured surface temperatures when compared against a temperature modulated black body target. The laboratory calibration process used a series of calibrated resistance temperature detectors to measure the temperature of a black body at different ambient temperatures to derive calibration equations for the thermal data acquired by the three sensors. As a point-collecting device, the Apogee sensor was corrected for sensor bias and ambient temperature influences. For the 2D thermal cameras, each pixel was calibrated independently, with results showing that measurement bias and vignette effects were greatly reduced for the FLIR A655sc (from a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.219 to 0.815 degrees Celsius (℃)) and TeAx 640 (from an RMSE of 3.438 to 1.013 ℃) cameras. This relatively straightforward approach for the radiometric calibration of infrared thermal sensors can enable more accurate surface temperature retrievals to support field and UAV‐based data collection efforts. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {An alternative to thermal infrared satellite sensors for measuring land surface temperature (Ts) is presented. The 37 GHz vertical polarized brightness temperature is used to derive Ts because it is considered the most appropriate microwave frequency for temperature retrieval. This channel balances a reduced sensitivity to soil surface characteristics with a relatively high atmospheric transmissivity. It is shown that with a simple linear relationship, accurate values for Ts can be obtained from this frequency, with a theoretical bias of within 1 K for 70\% of vegetated land areas of the globe. Barren, sparsely vegetated, and open shrublands cannot be accurately described with this single channel approach because variable surface conditions become important. The precision of the retrieved land surface temperature is expected to be better than 2.5 K for forests and 3.5 K for low vegetation. This method can be used to complement existing infrared derived temperature products, especially during clouded conditions. With several microwave radiometers currently in orbit, this method can be used to observe the diurnal temperature cycles with surprising accuracy.},

	abstract = {Leaves within a canopy may experience rapid and extreme fluctuations in ambient conditions. A shaded leaf, for example, may become exposed to an order of magnitude increase in solar radiation within a few seconds, due to sunflecks or canopy motions. Considering typical time scales for stomatal adjustments, (2 to 60 minutes), the gap between these two time scales raised the question whether leaves rely on their hydraulic and thermal capacitances for passive protection from hydraulic failure or over-heating until stomata have adjusted. We employed a physically based model to systematically study effects of short-term fluctuations in irradiance on leaf temperatures and transpiration rates. Considering typical amplitudes and time scales of such fluctuations, the importance of leaf heat and water capacities for avoiding damaging leaf temperatures and hydraulic failure were investigated. The results suggest that common leaf heat capacities are not sufficient to protect a non-transpiring leaf from over-heating during sunflecks of several minutes duration whereas transpirative cooling provides effective protection. A comparison of the simulated time scales for heat damage in the absence of evaporative cooling with observed stomatal response times suggested that stomata must be already open before arrival of a sunfleck to avoid over-heating to critical leaf temperatures. This is consistent with measured stomatal conductances in shaded leaves and has implications for water use efficiency of deep canopy leaves and vulnerability to heat damage during drought. Our results also suggest that typical leaf water contents could sustain several minutes of evaporative cooling during a sunfleck without increasing the xylem water supply and thus risking embolism. We thus submit that shaded leaves rely on hydraulic capacitance and evaporative cooling to avoid over-heating and hydraulic failure during exposure to typical sunflecks, whereas thermal capacitance provides limited protection for very short sunflecks (tens of seconds).},

Their actual temperature may deviate substantially from ambient atmospheric conditions as reported by weather stations. While there is a long tradition of false-colour imagery, new digital technologies in combination with IR transmission lenses and autocalibration routines permit unprecedented insight into the actual temperature regimes in canopies. We report canopy leaf temperature distribution over space and time assessed over a 35m tall mixed deciduous forest in NW Switzerland by means of a construction crane and a high resolution thermal camera. At an air temperature of 25°C, conifers (Picea abies, Pinus sylverstris and Larix decidua) and deciduous broad-leaved trees with exceptionally high transpiration (Quercus petraea) or very open, low density canopies (Prunus avium) exhibited mean canopy leaf temperatures close to air temperature (0.3–2.7K above ambient) and the maximum amplitude within a given crown reached 6–9K. In contrast, broad-leaved deciduous species with dense canopies (Fagus sylvatica, Carpinus betulus and Tilia platyphyllos) were 4.5–5K warmer than air temperature and showed within canopy temperature amplitudes of 10–12K. Calculated leaf boundary resistance was clearly lower for conifers (3–24ms−1) than for broad-leaved trees (33–64ms−1). The study illustrates that mean leaf temperatures in forest trees are not adequately explained by either stomatal conductance or leaf dimensions, but strongly depend on canopy architecture (leaf area density, branching habits) in combination with leaf traits. Aerodynamic leaf and canopy characteristics lead to strongly enhanced vapour pressure gradients (evaporative forcing) and leaf temperatures vary enormously over short distances, calling for statistical temperature models (frequency distribution) rather than the use of means in any flux calculations. The presence/absence of certain tree taxa plays a key role in forest surface temperature.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Diurnal temperature variations are strongly shaped by the absorption of solar radiation, but evaporation, or the latent heat flux, also plays an important role. Generally, evaporation cools. Its relation to diurnal temperature variations, however, is unclear. This study investigates the diurnal response of surface and air temperatures to evaporation for different vegetation types. We used the warming rate of temperature to absorbed solar radiation in the morning under clear-sky conditions and evaluated how the warming rates change for different evaporative fractions. Results for 51 FLUXNET sites show that the diurnal variation of air temperature carries very weak imprints of evaporation across all vegetation types. However, surface temperature warming rates of short vegetation decrease significantly by {\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;23\&thinsp;\&times;\&thinsp;10\&minus;3\&thinsp;K/W\&thinsp;m$^{\textrm{\&minus;2}}$ from dry to wet conditions. Contrarily, warming rates of surface and air temperatures are similar at forest sites and carry literally no imprints of evaporation. We explain these contrasting patterns with a surface energy balance model. The model reveals a strong sensitivity of the warming rates to evaporative fraction and aerodynamic conductance. However, for forests the sensitivity to evaporative fraction is strongly reduced by 74\&thinsp;\% due to their large aerodynamic conductance. The remaining imprint is reduced further by {\textasciitilde}\&thinsp;50\&thinsp;\% through their enhanced aerodynamic conductance under dry conditions. Our model then compares the individual contributions of solar radiation, evaporation and vegetation types in shaping the diurnal temperature range. These findings have implications for the interpretation of land-atmosphere interactions and the influences of water limitation and vegetation on diurnal temperatures, which is of key importance for ecological functioning. We conclude that diurnal temperature variations may be useful to predict evaporation for short vegetation. In forests, however, the diurnal variations in temperatures are mainly governed by their aerodynamic properties resulting in no imprint of evaporation in diurnal temperature variations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {More frequent and intense droughts are projected during the next century, potentially changing the hydrological balances in many forested catchments. Although the impacts of droughts on forest functionality have been vastly studied, little attention has been given to studying the effect of droughts on forest hydrology. Here, we use the Budyko framework and two recently introduced Budyko metrics (deviation and elasticity) to study the changes in the water yields (rainfall minus evapotranspiration) of forested catchments following a climatic drought (2006–2010) in pine forests distributed along a rainfall gradient (P = 280–820 mm yr−1) in the Eastern Mediterranean (aridity factor = 0.17–0.56). We use a satellite-based model and meteorological information to calculate the Budyko metrics. The relative water yield ranged from 48\% to 8\% (from the rainfall) in humid to dry forests and was mainly associated with rainfall amount (increasing with increased rainfall amount) and bedrock type (higher on hard bedrocks). Forest elasticity was larger in forests growing under drier conditions, implying that drier forests have more predictable responses to drought, according to the Budyko framework, compared to forests growing under more humid conditions. In this context, younger forests were shown more elastic than older forests. Dynamic deviation, which is defined as the water yield departure from the Budyko curve, was positive in all forests (i.e., less-than-expected water yields according to Budyko's curve), increasing with drought severity, suggesting lower hydrological resistance to drought in forests suffering from larger rainfall reductions. However, the dynamic deviation significantly decreased in forests that experienced relatively cooler conditions during the drought period. Our results suggest that forests growing under permanent dry conditions might develop a range of hydrological and eco-physiological adjustments to drought leading to higher hydrological resilience. In the context of predicted climate change, such adjustments are key factors in sustaining forested catchments in water-limited regions.},

	abstract = {Forests are undergoing significant changes throughout the globe. These changes can modify water, energy, and carbon balance of the land surface, which can ultimately affect climate. We utilize satellite data to quantify the potential and actual impacts of forest change on land surface temperature (LST) from 2003 to 2013. The potential effect of forest change on temperature is calculated by the LST difference between forest and nearby nonforest land, whereas the actual impact on temperature is quantified by the LST trend difference between deforested (afforested) and nearby unchanged forest (nonforest land) over several years. The good agreement found between potential and actual impacts both at annual and seasonal levels indicates that forest change can have detectable impacts on surface temperature trends. That impact, however, is different for maximum and minimum temperatures. Overall, deforestation caused a significant warming up to 0.28 K/decade on average temperature trends in tropical regions, a cooling up to −0.55 K/decade in boreal regions, a weak impact in the northern temperate regions, and strong warming (up to 0.32 K/decade) in the southern temperate regions. Afforestation induced an opposite impact on temperature trends. The magnitude of the estimated temperature impacts depends on both the threshold and the data set (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Landsat) by which forest cover change is defined. Such a latitudinal pattern in temperature impact is mainly caused by the competing effects of albedo and evapotranspiration on temperature. The methodology developed here can be used to evaluate the temperature change induced by forest cover change around the globe.},

Conclusions 15 Acknowledgements 15 References 15 Summary Severe droughts have been associated with regional-scale forest mortality worldwide. Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

	abstract = {Patterns, mechanisms, projections, and consequences of tree mortality and associated broad-scale forest die-off due to drought accompanied by warmer temperatures—“hotter drought”, an emerging characteristic of the Anthropocene—are the focus of rapidly expanding literature. Despite recent observational, experimental, and modeling studies suggesting increased vulnerability of trees to hotter drought and associated pests and pathogens, substantial debate remains among research, management and policy-making communities regarding future tree mortality risks. We summarize key mortality-relevant findings, differentiating between those implying lesser versus greater levels of vulnerability. Evidence suggesting lesser vulnerability includes forest benefits of elevated [CO2] and increased water-use efficiency; observed and modeled increases in forest growth and canopy greening; widespread increases in woody-plant biomass, density, and extent; compensatory physiological, morphological, and genetic mechanisms; dampening ecological feedbacks; and potential mitigation by forest management. In contrast, recent studies document more rapid mortality under hotter drought due to negative tree physiological responses and accelerated biotic attacks. Additional evidence suggesting greater vulnerability includes rising background mortality rates; projected increases in drought frequency, intensity, and duration; limitations of vegetation models such as inadequately represented mortality processes; warming feedbacks from die-off; and wildfire synergies. Grouping these findings we identify ten contrasting perspectives that shape the vulnerability debate but have not been discussed collectively. We also present a set of global vulnerability drivers that are known with high confidence: (1) droughts eventually occur everywhere; (2) warming produces hotter droughts; (3) atmospheric moisture demand increases nonlinearly with temperature during drought; (4) mortality can occur faster in hotter drought, consistent with fundamental physiology; (5) shorter droughts occur more frequently than longer droughts and can become lethal under warming, increasing the frequency of lethal drought nonlinearly; and (6) mortality happens rapidly relative to growth intervals needed for forest recovery. These high-confidence drivers, in concert with research supporting greater vulnerability perspectives, support an overall viewpoint of greater forest vulnerability globally. We surmise that mortality vulnerability is being discounted in part due to difficulties in predicting threshold responses to extreme climate events. Given the profound ecological and societal implications of underestimating global vulnerability to hotter drought, we highlight urgent challenges for research, management, and policy-making communities.},

Although Mediterranean-type forest (MTF) ecosystems are considered to be resilient to drought and other disturbances, we observed a sudden and unprecedented forest collapse in a MTF in Western Australia corresponding with record dry and heat conditions in 2010/2011. An aerial survey and subsequent field investigation were undertaken to examine: the incidence and severity of canopy dieback and stem mortality, associations between canopy health and stand-related factors as well as tree species response. Canopy mortality was found to be concentrated in distinct patches, representing 1.5 \% of the aerial sample (1,350 ha). Within these patches, 74 \% of all measured stems ({\textgreater}1 cm DBHOB) had dying or recently killed crowns, leading to 26 \% stem mortality six months following the collapse. Patches of canopy collapse were more densely stocked with the dominant species, Eucalyptus marginata, and lacked the prominent midstorey species Banksia grandis, compared to the surrounding forest. A differential response to the disturbance was observed among co-occurring tree species, which suggests contrasting strategies for coping with extreme water stress. These results suggest that MTFs, once thought to be resilient to climate change, are susceptible to sudden and severe forest collapse when key thresholds have been reached.},

The leaf size maximizing the rate of photosynthesis per unit leaf area (A) at a high irradiance differed depending on the air temperature. In warm environments, A increased with decrease in leaf size, whereas in cool environments, there was the leaf size maximizing A. With the increase in leaf size, the CO2 concentration inside the leaf (Ci) decreased and the leaf temperature increased, both due to lower boundary layer conductance. At low air temperatures, the negative effect of low Ci on A in large leaves was compensated by the increase in leaf temperature towards the optimum temperature for A. This balance determined the optimum leaf size for A at low air temperatures. With respect to water use efficiency, large leaves tended to be advantageous, especially in cool environments at low-to-medium irradiances. Some temperature-dependent trends in leaf size observed in nature are discussed based on the present results.},

The leaves responded to their external environment in accordance with accepted heat transfer theory. Leaf—air temperature differences were maximum for non—transpiring leaves in still air, and minimum for transpiring leaves exposed to high wind velocities. Convective heat transfer coefficients, calculated from the measurements of convection, were compared with those determined from heat transfer theory. The forced convection coefficients agreed closely with those predicted by theory. The free convection coefficients, however, were close to the theoretical values only for the larger leaves. They increased to about twice the predicted values as leaf size decreased. Reasons for this difference are discussed. The ratios between convection and latent heat exchange (Bowen ratios) for the individual leaves were different from published values for whole forest stands.

	abstract = {The interplay between macroclimate and vegetation in the wet tropics creates leaf microclimates in which light intensity, humidity, air temperature, and wind velocity tend to be correlated. Along a vertical transect through the forest, this creates an increase in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) with increasing height. The correlated changes in environmental factors act to narrow the range of microclimates encountered along a vertical transect through the forest, making it possible to simulate leaf energy balance for “typical” microhabitats. Basing the simulations on leaves of the size most frequently encountered and with stomatal responses to light and VPD, leaf energy balance along a vertical gradient from forest floor to canopy can be summarized as follows:As a result of high ({\textgreater}90\%) humidities and low radiation in the understory, leaf temperatures are generally very close to air temperature. As radiation increases and humidity decreases, leaf overtemperatures rise to about 6°C, and transpiration rates increase. Simulations and several observations suggest that leaf temperatures near the top of the canopy or in clearings can exceed 40°C under moderately high radiation.Leaf size has received considerable study in the wet tropics. Trends toward leaves larger than the predominant size (the mesophyll) occur with increasing moisture and increasing shade, but gap species often have large leaves.Optimization models have predicted that leaf size should be maximal in either the lowest or the intermediate strata. Simulations with varying leaf size and stomatal conductance suggest that leaf size has little effect on energy balance in understories and that interactions with conductance determine the consequences of leaf size in open conditions.General trends in leaf energy balance for a number of sites and habitat types are not yet available. Further studies are needed of stomatal conductance and responses to VPD, leaf temperature relations, and absorptance properties.},

Linkages between atmospheric turbulence and biological control impact horizontal scalar source distributions. Decreasing spatial correlation between momentum and scalar fluxes with increasing instability results from ABL-scale structures spatially segregating momentum and scalar exchange at canopy top. In combination, these results suggest the need for roughness sublayer parameterizations to incorporate an additional length or time scale reflecting the influence of ABL-scale organized motions.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an energy balance modelling approach to predict the nightly water yield and the surface temperature (Tf) of two passive radiative dew condensers (RDCs) tilted 30° from horizontal. One was fitted with a white hydrophilic polyethylene foil recommended for dew harvest and the other with a black polyethylene foil widely used in horticulture. The model was validated in south-eastern Spain by comparing the simulation outputs with field measurements of Tf and dew yield. The results indicate that the model is robust and accurate in reproducing the behaviour of the two RDCs, especially in what refers to Tf, whose estimates were very close to the observations. The results were somewhat less precise for dew yield, with a larger scatter around the 1:1 relationship. A sensitivity analysis showed that the simulated dew yield was highly sensitive to changes in relative humidity and downward longwave radiation. The proposed approach provides a useful tool to water managers for quantifying the amount of dew that could be harvested as a valuable water resource in arid, semiarid and water stressed regions.},

	abstract = {Convective heat and mass exchange of leaves with the environment is relevant for a better understanding of plant physiological processes in response to environmental factors for a wide range of applications. Methods for quantifying these exchanges have been a subject of active research, as they allow to explain the functions of leaves, their effects on gas and water transport in plants and the heat and mass exchange of plant canopies with the environment. Furthermore, they provide input on these exchange rates to simulation models of pre- and postharvest operations and of leaf/plant/tree/canopy-environment systems. An overview is given on the different methods to obtain convective transfer predictions, namely analytical, experimental (i.e., by laboratory or field tests) and numerical methods, and their restrictions and current knowledge gaps are identified. Analytical methods for flat plates are the most simplified approach but lack physical similarity with real leaves. The majority of the methods used are however sensor-based, using real, artificial but also virtual leaf sensors. For experimental research in the field or in the laboratory (e.g., wind tunnel), special attention is given here to the sensors used, namely real and artificial leaves. Numerical methods are based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations to predict air-side convective transfer on virtual leaves, but have not been readily applied at leaf and sub-leaf level, despite their large potential here. Instead of commonly-used convective transfer coefficients, CFD allows direct, case-specific predictions of convective transfer, at different levels of complexity and at a very high spatial and temporal resolution. A particular difficulty in all methods is to account for stomata, which result in very heterogeneous heat and mass boundary conditions over the leaf surface at microscale level, and also for microscale surface roughness (e.g., trichomes). Future perspectives are mainly oriented towards CFD, but the challenge will be to model convective transfer at multiple scales and to couple them using a multiscale approach.},

Here we compare six studies, including enough data for such a general quantification, to build up a general pattern of the relative importance of several energy dissipation mechanisms in response to drought in C3 plants. Such a general pattern apparently emerges independently of specific acclimation to drought, but largely dependent on CO2 availability in the chloroplasts, which may be regulated under drought by adjustments in stomatal and mesophyll conductances. Under irrigation and saturating light, more than 50\% of absorbed light is thermally dissipated, while photosynthesis dissipates 20–30\% and photorespiration 10–20\%. Under mild drought, the contribution of photosynthesis decreases, and that of photorespiration increases in a compensatory manner. During moderate to severe drought, the contribution of both photosynthesis and photorespiration decreases, and thermal dissipation increases up to 70–90\% of the total light absorbed. The contribution of other processes, like the Mehler reaction, is shown to be very low under both irrigation and drought. Therefore, in C3 plants subjected to different degrees of drought, more than 90\% of the total energy absorbed by leaves is dissipated by the sum of thermal dissipation, photorespiration and photosynthesis.},

	abstract = {The temperature of any plant organ depends on the balance between incoming energy and energy loss. The energy exchanges involved include radiative transfer, sensible heat transfer by convection processes, latent heat transfer as a result of evaporation and transfer to and from storage (by conduction). The radiative transfer is frequently classified into either short-wave (or solar) radiation and long-wave (or thermal) radiation; these contribute differently to the overall energy balance. Various biophysical mechanisms are available to plants, through manipulation of the energy balance terms, for temperature regulation. For example, enhanced evaporation can help cool leaves in hot environments, whereas maximising absorption of sunlight can raise the temperature in cold environments. This article outlines the relative importance of these different processes in both leaf and canopy temperature regulation, highlighting differences between treatment of the energy balance at leaf and canopy scales. Examples of applications, such as the measurement of canopy temperature to determine plant water stress or to aid in the selection of drought tolerant varieties of plants, are also discussed.

Key Concepts:




* A critical requirement of plants is that they maintain their leaf temperature as close as possible to the optimal temperature for growth; plants have a range of mechanisms that help them to optimise their temperature.

* Leaf and canopy temperature are dependent on the leaf energy balance, which itself is dominated by radiant exchanges.

* Radiation in natural environments relevant to leaf energy balance is conventionally separated into the ultraviolet (0.2–0.38 μm), the visible (0.38–0.7 μm) and the infra-red (0.7–100 μm).

* Radiation coming from the sun is often termed short-wave radiation, about half of which is in the visible region, a small amount in the ultraviolet, and the remainder in the near infra-red (0.7–3 μm).

* Long-wave, or thermal radiation is conventionally taken as the radiation between 3 (or sometimes 4) μm and 100 μm. The radiation emitted by natural surfaces as a function of their temperature is primarily in this wave-band.

* The thermal radiation emitted by any body increases according to the fourth power of the temperature (Stefan–Boltzmann's law).

* Leaf and canopy temperatures depend on the exchanges of energy between plants and the atmosphere both through radiation exchange and by means of sensible heat and latent heat fluxes.

* Leaf temperature therefore depends on the radiation climate (time of day, cloud cover and type, etc.), atmospheric conditions (wind speed, temperature, etc.), the soil conditions (soil type, water content, etc.) and the canopy properties (such as plant morphology, density, height, etc.) that together affect the size and ratios of the radiant, sensible and latent heat fluxes.

* Measurement of leaf temperature using infra-red thermometry or thermography can be used to detect plant water-deficit stress and to screen plants for their drought tolerance.},

Increasing aridity due to climate change is expected to affect multiple ecosystem structural and functional attributes in global drylands, which cover ∼45\% of the terrestrial globe. Berdugo et al. show that increasing aridity promotes thresholds on the structure and functioning of drylands (see the Perspective by Hirota and Oliveira). Their database includes 20 variables summarizing multiple aspects and levels of ecological organization. They found evidence for a series of abrupt ecological events occurring sequentially in three phases, culminating with a shift to low-cover ecosystems that are nutrient- and species-poor at high aridity values. They estimate that more than 20\% of land surface will cross at least one of the thresholds by 2100, which can potentially lead to widespread land degradation and desertification worldwide.
Science, this issue p. 787; see also p. 739
Aridity, which is increasing worldwide because of climate change, affects the structure and functioning of dryland ecosystems. Whether aridification leads to gradual (versus abrupt) and systemic (versus specific) ecosystem changes is largely unknown. We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20\% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.
Increasing aridity promotes sequential, systemic, and abrupt thresholds in drylands worldwide.

For A. lasiocarpa, transpiration was calculated to be 44\% less and photosynthesis 17\% less due to the presence of Rwva, which led to a predicted increase in WUE of 57\% compared to the calculated WUE when Rwva was assumed negligible. Similar increases in WUE were computed for P. contorta (48\%) with somewhat smaller values for J. communis (34\%). These results are discussed in terms of the estimated importance of Rwva on water and photosynthetic relations of plants that have relatively low stomatal resistances and grow in microhabitats with low winds.},

Just as terrestrial plant biomass is growing in response to increasing atmospheric CO2, climate change, and other anthropogenic influences, so is climate affected by those variations in vegetation. Forzieri et al. used satellite observations to analyze how changes in leaf area index (LAI), a measure of vegetation density, have influenced the terrestrial energy balance and local climates over the past several decades. An increase in LAI has helped to warm boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to cool arid regions of the southern hemisphere by increasing surface evaporation. Furthermore, more densely vegetated areas displayed a greater capacity to mitigate the impact of rapid climate fluctuations on the surface energy budget.
Science, this issue p. 1180
Changes in vegetation cover associated with the observed greening may affect several biophysical processes, whose net effects on climate are unclear. We analyzed remotely sensed dynamics in leaf area index (LAI) and energy fluxes in order to explore the associated variation in local climate. We show that the increasing trend in LAI contributed to the warming of boreal zones through a reduction of surface albedo and to an evaporation-driven cooling in arid regions. The interplay between LAI and surface biophysics is amplified up to five times under extreme warm-dry and cold-wet years. Altogether, these signals reveal that the recent dynamics in global vegetation have had relevant biophysical impacts on the local climates and should be considered in the design of local mitigation and adaptation plans.

	abstract = {Drought-induced productivity reductions and tree mortality have been increasing in recent decades in forests around the globe. Prescribed reduction in stand density, i.e. thinning, has been proposed as a management tool to improve forest sustainability in face of a warmer, drier future. Thinning should potentially reduce net stand water use and improve water-availability for remaining trees, thus reducing their subsequent drought vulnerability. However, few studies have directly measured these effects. In 2009 we established a large-scale thinning experiment in a semi-arid, 40-years-old pine afforestation. Study plots (70 × 70 m) were thinned to 100, 200, and 300 trees ha−1, and compared with unthinned control plots (210–400 trees ha−1), each at five replications. Stem and needle growth, and needle gas exchange were measured along 3–9 consecutive years at seasonal to annual temporal resolution. Measurements at the tree-scale were further up-scaled using both simple upscaling relationships and using an ecosystem model of coupled carbon, energy and hydrology (Regional Hydro Ecologic Simulation System, RHESSys). At the needle scale, photosynthesis was 70\% higher at the 100 trees ha−1 than at 300 trees ha−1, whereas transpiration was merely 10\% higher. Consequently, stem and needle growth increased by 100\% and 20\%, respectively. For most parameters, there was little change between 200 and 100 trees ha−1. Applying RHESSys at the stand-scale, these effects on tree physiology translated into 35\% reduction in CO2 uptake and a 47\% reduction in tree water-use, which was compensated for by increased evaporation from exposed soil. Our long-term measurements at the dry timberline highlight the role of thinning in enhancing the activity and growth of remaining trees, with increased water-use efficiency. Unexpectedly, this density reduction was associated with a relatively small decrease in forest carbon uptake. Light availability was a limiting factor in the higher density plots, even in our light-abundant forest.},

	abstract = {Savannas are known as ecosystems with tree cover below climate-defined equilibrium values. However, a predictive framework for understanding constraints on tree cover is lacking. We present (a) a spatially extensive analysis of tree cover and fire distribution in sub-Saharan Africa, and (b) a model, based on empirical results, demonstrating that savanna and forest may be alternative stable states in parts of Africa, with implications for understanding savanna distributions. Tree cover does not increase continuously with rainfall, but rather is constrained to low ({\textless}50\%, “savanna”) or high tree cover ({\textgreater}75\%, “forest”). Intermediate tree cover rarely occurs. Fire, which prevents trees from establishing, differentiates high and low tree cover, especially in areas with rainfall between 1000 mm and 2000 mm. Fire is less important at low rainfall ({\textless}1000 mm), where rainfall limits tree cover, and at high rainfall ({\textgreater}2000 mm), where fire is rare. This pattern suggests that complex interactions between climate and disturbance produce emergent alternative states in tree cover. The relationship between tree cover and fire was incorporated into a dynamic model including grass, savanna tree saplings, and savanna trees. Only recruitment from sapling to adult tree varied depending on the amount of grass in the system. Based on our empirical analysis and previous work, fires spread only at tree cover of 40\% or less, producing a sigmoidal fire probability distribution as a function of grass cover and therefore a sigmoidal sapling to tree recruitment function. This model demonstrates that, given relatively conservative and empirically supported assumptions about the establishment of trees in savannas, alternative stable states for the same set of environmental conditions (i.e., model parameters) are possible via a fire feedback mechanism. Integrating alternative stable state dynamics into models of biome distributions could improve our ability to predict changes in biome distributions and in carbon storage under climate and global change scenarios.},

In very sparse crops changes in the surface resistance of the substrate are shown to contaminate the calculated canopy resistance, tending to amplify the apparent response to changes in water availability. the theory is developed to allow the use of a measurement of substrate temperature as an option to mitigate this contamination.},

The tree is a pre-fractal with five generations, each consisting of three branches and a scale-reduction factor of 1/2 between consecutive generations. Detailed mean velocity and turbulence stress profiles are documented, as well as their downstream development. Scatter plots of mean velocity gradient (transverse shear in the wake) and Reynolds shear stress exhibit a good linear relation at all locations in the flow. Therefore, in the transverse direction of the wake evolution, the data support the Boussinesq eddy-viscosity concept. The measured mixing length increases with streamwise distance, in agreement with classic wake expansion rates. Conversely, the measured eddy viscosity and mixing length in the transverse direction decrease with increasing elevation, which differs from the behaviours measured in the vertical direction in traditional boundary layers or in canopy flows studied before. In order to find an appropriate single length scale to describe the wake evolution behind a multiscale object, two models are proposed, based on the notion of superposition of scales. One approach is based on the radial spectrum of the object while the second is based on its length-scale distribution evaluated using fractal geometry tools. Both proposed models agree well with the measured mixing length. The results suggest that information about multiscale clustering of branches must be incorporated into models of the mixing length for flows through single or sparse canopies of multiscale trees.},

	abstract = {Land use and land cover changes greatly influence surface energy balance and consequently climate, and are likely to be associated with the persistent predictions of warming and drying throughout the Mediterranean and other regions. We specifically address the question of how the high radiation load and suppressed latent heat flux, intrinsic to dry regions, interact with land use changes and climate in these environments. We use for this purpose a detailed 6-year (2003–2008) study of the redistribution of the radiation load in an open-canopy pine forest. The results show that compared with the background shrubland, there was a 23.8 W m−2 increase in shortwave radiation load on the forest (to a mean annual net solar radiation of 211 W m−2) associated with a decrease in albedo of 0.1. Surface (skin) temperature in the forest was lower than in the shrubland (by ∼5 °C on average) due to an efficient ‘convector effect’ and the production of a large sensible heat flux (up to 926 W m−2 in summer), which effectively shifted heat from the canopy to the overlying boundary layer. The cooler forest skin temperature resulted in suppression of upwelling longwave radiation (by 25 W m−2, annual average), further increasing the forest radiation load (mean annual net radiation of 116 and 67 W m−2 for forest and shrubland, respectively). This suppression also resulted in a local ‘canopy greenhouse effect’, where upwelling longwave radiation from the ground to the canopy was larger than from the canopy to the atmosphere (by up to 150 W m−2 in summer) and was associated with ∼3 °C warming below the canopy. The ability of the dry productive forest to deal with the high radiation load indicates the potential for afforestation in dry areas.},

For the whole study area, forest structural parameters including tree height (Ht) (m), first branch height (FBH) (m), crown width (CW) (m) and stand density (SD)(treesha−1) were derived by stepwise multiple linear regressions of ground-based forest measurements and height quantiles and fractional canopy cover (fc) derived from the low density LiDAR data. The high density LiDAR data, which covered a much smaller area than the low density LiDAR data, were used to relate SPOT-5's reflectance to the effective plant area index (PAIe) of the forest. This was done by linear spectrum decomposition and Li–Strahler geometric–optical models. The result of the SPOT-5 spectrum decomposition was applied to the whole area to calculate PAIe (and leaf area index LAI). Then, four roughness models were applied to the study area with these vegetation data derived from the LiDAR and SPOT-5 as input. For validation, measurements at an eddy covariance site in the study area were used. Finally, the four models were compared by plotting histograms of the accumulative distribution of modeled d and z0m in the study area. The results showed that the model using by frontal area index (FAI) produced best d estimate, and the model using both LAI and FAI generated the best z0m. Furthermore, all models performed much better when the representative tree height was Lorey's mean height instead of using an arithmetic mean.},

The aerodynamic resistance was determined by non-dimensional groups. Three relationships for estimating the aerodynamic resistance were compared. The aerodynamic resistance in a cooler-than-air situation was found larger than that in a warmer-than-air situation owing to downward mixing of warmer, lighter air. The calculated sensible heat fluxes were compared with energy balance estimates. The resistance form equation for sensible heat flux and the Penman-Monteith equation are sensitive to the errors in aerodynamic resistance, but these errors have much less effect on latent heat flux estimates from the energy balance equation. Estimates of evapotranspiration from both the energy balance and the Penman-Monteith equations are close to measured evapotranspiration.

Leaf temperature measurement may be affected by this error if the leaf-to-air temperature difference is large and contact between TC and leaf is inadequate. Selection of small diameter TCs with low thermal conductivity, as well as good contact with the leaf, are possible solutions to the problem. A laboratory experiment was carried out to determine conduction error as a function of TC-type, wire diameter, insulation and length of contact between wire and leaf. Most of the tests were conducted with a thin plastic plate, as a leaf-substitute, to ensure repetitiveness. Some measurements were also made with in vivo pepper and tomato leaves, to determine a correction factor. Different lengths of the TC wires were glued to the plate, or leaf, to ensure good contact. Controllable temperature differences were established with a thermo-electric cooler. A conduction error, τ, of 1\% (relative to the leaf-to-air temperature difference) is to be expected when a length of about 22mm of AWG 40 (0.08mm diameter), teflon-insulated type-T (copper–constantan) thermocouple is glued to a leaf. Removing the insulation reduces this length to 14mm, and replacing the insulated type-T thermocouple by an insulated type-K (chromel–alumel) thermocouple of the same gage, requires about 10mm for the same 1\% error. An approximate theoretical solution was obtained, which relates relative measurement error, τ, to normalized glued length, ξ, in the form τ=exp\{−ξ\}. This relationship can be used to estimate errors with other TCs.},

Our results showed that there was no significant difference in the light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Asat) between native Masson\&rsquo;s pine and exotic slash pine. The seasonal patterns of maximum rate of the carboxylation (Vcmax25) were basically consistent with seasonal patterns of Asat for both species. The positive effect of leaf temperature on Asat was mainly produced through its positive effect on Vcmax25. Leaf temperature had no significant effect on stomatal conductance. Vcmax25 and gs simultaneously affected Asat in response to VPD. Our results highlighted the importance of biochemical processes in limiting leaf photosynthetic rate in response to environmental conditions in subtropical evergreen coniferous plantations.},

The heat flux enhancement is found to be largest for wide cavities between the obstacles which can be ‘washed out’ by the flow. This is also manifested in an empirical relation, which is based on the DNS data. We further discuss theoretical limiting cases for very wide and very narrow obstacles and combine them into a simple model for the heat flux enhancement due to the wall roughness, without introducing any free parameters. This model predicts well the general trends and the order of magnitude of the heat flux enhancement obtained in the DNS. In the

Ra{\textbackslash}mathit\{Ra\}



 the scaling exponent saturates to the one for smooth plates, which can be understood as a full washing-out of the cavities. The latter is also investigated by considering the strength of the mean secondary flow in the cavities and its relation to the wind (i.e. the large-scale circulation), that develops in the core part of the domain. Generally, an increase in the roughness height leads to stronger flows both in the cavities and in the bulk region, while an increase in the width of the obstacles strengthens only the large-scale circulation of the fluid and weakens the secondary flows. An increase of the Rayleigh number always leads to stronger flows, both in the cavities and in the bulk.},

Leaf-level temperature-photosynthesis curves, and comparisons of whole-canopy net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) with air temperature, showed that CO2 uptake declined sharply during warm periods. Observations of ambient leaf microclimate showed that leaves oscillate between two states: a cool, dimly lit stage and a hot, brightly illuminated stage where leaf temperatures are often greater than 35°C. The leaf-level rates of photosynthesis decreased when shaded leaves (∼ambient air temperature and {\textless} 500 μmol m−2 s−1) were transferred into a prewarmed, brightly illuminated chamber (35° to 38°C and 1000 μmol m−2 s−1), coincident with increased leaf temperature, increased evaporative demand, and stomatal closure. The rates of whole-canopy CO2 uptake calculated at 5-min intervals increased initially at the onset of sunny periods that followed extended cloudy periods, but then decreased as the sunlight continued, leaf temperature and evaporative demand increased, and canopy conductance decreased. The forest at km-83 appears to be close to a high temperature threshold, above which CO2 uptake drops sharply. This sensitivity results in part from the covariance between leaf temperature and leaf illumination; the brightly illuminated leaves that contribute disproportionately to canopy photosynthesis are warmed to the point that leaf gas exchange is curtailed.},

Forests in drylands are much more extensive than previously reported and cover a total area similar to that of tropical rainforests or boreal forests. This increases estimates of global forest cover by at least 9\%, a finding that will be important in estimating the terrestrial carbon sink.

Dryland biomes cover two-fifths of Earth’s land surface, but their forest area is poorly known. Here, we report an estimate of global forest extent in dryland biomes, based on analyzing more than 210,000 0.5-hectare sample plots through a photo-interpretation approach using large databases of satellite imagery at (i) very high spatial resolution and (ii) very high temporal resolution, which are available through the Google Earth platform. We show that in 2015, 1327 million hectares of drylands had more than 10\% tree-cover, and 1079 million hectares comprised forest. Our estimate is 40 to 47\% higher than previous estimates, corresponding to 467 million hectares of forest that have never been reported before.

Current knowledge of near-surface temperature trends with respect to height, however, is limited and inadequately understood because surface temperature observations at different heights in the surface layer of the world are rare especially from a high-quality and long-term climate monitoring network. Here we use high-quality two-height Oklahoma Mesonet observations, synchronized in time, fixed in height, and situated in relatively flat terrain, to assess temperature trends and differentiating temperature trends with respect to heights (i.e., near-surface lapse rate trend) over the period 1997 to 2013. We show that the near-surface lapse rate has significantly decreased with a trend of -0.18 +/- 0.03 degrees C (10 m)(-1) per decade indicating that the 9m height temperatures increased faster than temperatures at the 1.5m screen level and/or conditions at the 1.5m height cooled faster than at the 9m height. However, neither of the two individual height temperature trends by themselves were statistically significant. The magnitude of lapse rate trend is greatest under lighter winds at night. Nighttime lapse rate trends were significantly more negative than daytime lapse rate trends and the average lapse rate trend was three times more negative under calm conditions than under windy conditions. Our results provide the first observational evidence of near-surface temperature changes with respect to height that could enhance the assessment of climate model predictions.},

Although long recognized scientifically as being important, these so-called biogeophysical forcings are rarely included in climate policies for forestry and other land management projects due to the many challenges associated with their quantification. Here, we review the scientific literature in the fields of atmospheric science and terrestrial ecology in light of three main objectives: (i) to elucidate the challenges associated with quantifying biogeophysical climate forcings connected to land use and land management, with a focus on the forestry sector; (ii) to identify and describe scientific approaches and/or metrics facilitating the quantification and interpretation of direct biogeophysical climate forcings; and (iii) to identify and recommend research priorities that can help overcome the challenges of their attribution to specific land-use activities, bridging the knowledge gap between the climate modeling, forest ecology, and resource management communities. We find that ignoring surface biogeophysics may mislead climate mitigation policies, yet existing metrics are unlikely to be sufficient. Successful metrics ought to (i) include both radiative and nonradiative climate forcings; (ii) reconcile disparities between biogeophysical and biogeochemical forcings, and (iii) acknowledge trade-offs between global and local climate benefits. We call for more coordinated research among terrestrial ecologists, resource managers, and coupled climate modelers to harmonize datasets, refine analytical techniques, and corroborate and validate metrics that are more amenable to analyses at the scale of an individual site or region.},

Observations from seven field sites are used to evaluate these flux products, including four reanalysis data sets and three produced by off-line land surface models. In general, the expected seasonal variations and spatial patterns in major climatic regimes are well reproduced by all reanalysis and modeling products. However, large differences among the four reanalysis products are found, while the three off-line land surface modeling products correlate well with each other. Looking at the Bowen ratio, it is found that the off-line land surface models convert a larger fraction of surface available energy into sensible heat flux compared to the reanalysis products in all climatic regimes. There are three centers of high interannual variability in sensible heat located in West China, Northeast China, and the eastern Inner Mongolia, respectively. In addition, the sensible heat flux agrees better with observations at grassland sites than at forest sites, while the latent heat flux and net radiation are significantly overestimated at forest sites in all the flux products. Besides, mean square errors of the fluxes are decomposed into biases, correlations, and differences in standard deviation. Finally, based on a ranking system adopted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of each data set, it is found that the surface energy fluxes in ERA-Interim and JRA-25 agree well with observations and the ensemble mean of all these products remains reasonably realistic as well.},

	abstract = {Land cover and land use influence surface climate through differences in biophysical surface properties, including partitioning of sensible and latent heat (e.g., Bowen ratio), surface roughness, and albedo. Clusters of closely spaced eddy covariance towers (e.g., {\textless}10km) over a variety of land cover and land use types provide a unique opportunity to study the local effects of land cover and land use on surface temperature. We assess contributions albedo, energy redistribution due to differences in surface roughness and energy redistribution due to differences in the Bowen ratio using two eddy covariance tower clusters and the coupled (land-atmosphere) Variable-Resolution Community Earth System Model. Results suggest that surface roughness is the dominant biophysical factor contributing to differences in surface temperature between forested and deforested lands. Surface temperature of open land is cooler (−4.8°C to −0.05°C) than forest at night and warmer (+0.16°C to +8.2°C) during the day at northern and southern tower clusters throughout the year, consistent with modeled calculations. At annual timescales, the biophysical contributions of albedo and Bowen ratio have a negligible impact on surface temperature, however the higher albedo of snow-covered open land compared to forest leads to cooler winter surface temperatures over open lands (−0.4°C to −0.8°C). In both the models and observation, the difference in mid-day surface temperature calculated from the sum of the individual biophysical factors is greater than the difference in surface temperature calculated from radiative temperature and potential temperature. Differences in measured and modeled air temperature at the blending height, assumptions about independence of biophysical factors, and model biases in surface energy fluxes may contribute to daytime biases.},

	abstract = {Land use change and management affect climate by altering both the biogeochemical and biophysical interactions between the land and atmosphere. Whereas climate policy often emphasizes the biogeochemical impact of land use change, biophysical impacts, including changes in reflectance, energy partitioning among sensible and latent heat exchange, and surface roughness, can attenuate or enhance biogeochemical effects at local to regional scales. This study analyzes 3 years (2015–2017) of turbulent flux and meteorological data across three contrasting wetland restoration sites and one agricultural site, colocated in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California, USA, to understand if the biophysical impacts of freshwater wetland restoration can be expected to attenuate or enhance the potential biogeochemical benefits. We show that despite absorbing more net radiation, restored wetlands have the potential to cool daytime surface temperature by up to 5.1 °C, as compared to a dominant drained agricultural land use. Wetland canopy structure largely determines the magnitude of surface temperature cooling, with wetlands that contain areas of open water leading to enhanced nighttime latent heat flux and reduced diurnal temperate range. Daytime surface cooling could be important in ameliorating physiological stress associated with hotter and drier conditions and could also promote boundary layer feedbacks at the local to regional scale. With a renewed focus on the mitigation and adaptation potential of natural and working lands, we must better understand the role of biophysical changes, especially in novel land use transitions like wetland restoration.},

This study critically assessed the impact of conductance parameterizations on ET simulation using three structurally different SEB and SVAT models for an ecologically important North-Eastern European wetland, Upper Biebrza National Park (UBNP) in two consecutive years 2015 and 2016. A pronounced ET underestimation (mean bias \&minus;0.48 to \&minus;0.68 mm day\&minus;1) in SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) was associated with an overestimation of gA due to uncertain parameterization of momentum roughness length and bare soil\&rsquo;s excess resistance to heat transfer (kB\&minus;1) under low vegetation cover. The systematic ET overestimation (0.65\&ndash;0.80 mm day\&minus;1) in SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) was attributed to the overestimation of both the conductances. Conductance parameterizations in SEBS and SCOPE appeared to be very sensitive to the general ecohydrological conditions, with a tendency of overestimating gA (gS) under humid (arid) conditions. Low ET bias in the analytical STIC (Surface Temperature Initiated Closure) model as compared to SEBS/SCOPE indicated the critical need for calibration-free conductance parameterizations for improved ET estimation.},

	abstract = {Reforesting and managing ecosystems have been proposed as ways to mitigate global warming and offset anthropogenic carbon emissions. The intent of our opinion piece is to provide a perspective on how well plants and ecosystems sequester carbon. The ability of individual plants and ecosystems to mine carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as defined by rates and cumulative amounts, is limited by laws of physics and ecological principles. Consequently, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are slow and low compared to the rates and amounts of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Managing ecosystems to sequester carbon can also cause unintended consequences to arise. In this paper, we articulate a series of key take-home points. First, the potential amount of carbon an ecosystem can assimilate on an annual basis scales with absorbed sunlight, which varies with latitude, leaf area index and available water. Second, efforts to improve photosynthesis will come with the cost of more respiration. Third, the rates and amount of net carbon uptake are relatively slow and low, compared to the rates and amounts and rates of carbon dioxide we release by fossil fuels combustion. Fourth, huge amounts of land area for ecosystems will be needed to be an effective carbon sink to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions. Fifth, the effectiveness of using this land as a carbon sink will depend on its ability to remain as a permanent carbon sink. Sixth, converting land to forests or wetlands may have unintended costs that warm the local climate, such as changing albedo, increasing surface roughness or releasing other greenhouse gases. We based our analysis on 1,163 site-years of direct eddy covariance measurements of gross and net carbon fluxes from 155 sites across the globe.},

	abstract = {Thermal infrared remote sensing observations have been widely used to provide useful information on surface energy and water stress for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). However, the revisit time of current high spatial resolution (\&lt;100 m) thermal infrared remote sensing systems, sixteen days for Landsat for example, can be insufficient to reliably derive ET information for water resources management. We used in situ ET measurements from multiple Ameriflux sites to (1) evaluate different scaling methods that are commonly used to derive daytime ET estimates from time-of-day observations; and (2) quantify the impact of different revisit times on ET estimates at monthly and seasonal time scales. The scaling method based on a constant evaporative ratio between ET and the top-of-atmosphere solar radiation provided slightly better results than methods using the available energy, the surface solar radiation or the potential ET as scaling reference fluxes. On average, revisit time periods of 2, 4, 8 and 16 days resulted in ET uncertainties of 0.37, 0.55, 0.73 and 0.90 mm per day in summer, which represented 13\%, 19\%, 23\% and 31\% of the monthly average ET calculated using the one-day revisit dataset. The capability of a system to capture rapid changes in ET was significantly reduced for return periods higher than eight days. The impact of the revisit on ET depended mainly on the land cover type and seasonal climate, and was higher over areas with high ET. We did not observe significant and systematic differences between the impacts of the revisit on monthly ET estimates that are based on morning or afternoon observations. We found that four-day revisit scenarios provided a significant improvement in temporal sampling to monitor surface ET reducing by around 40\% the uncertainty of ET products derived from a 16-day revisit system, such as Landsat for instance.},

To accommodate the changes in (i) and (ii) above, the original two-layer vegetation canopy structure of SiB2 has been reduced to a single layer in SiB2. The use of satellite data in SiB2 and the performance of SiB2 when coupled to a GCM are described in the two companion papers, Part II and III.},

However, evidence suggests that increasing wind speed enhances carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake while reducing transpiration because of more efficient convective cooling (under high solar radiation loads). We provide theoretical and experimental evidence that leaf water use efficiency (WUE, carbon uptake per water transpired) commonly increases with increasing wind speed, thus improving plants' ability to conserve water during photosynthesis. Our leaf-scale analysis suggests that the observed global decrease in near-surface wind speeds could have reduced WUE at a magnitude similar to the increase in WUE attributed to global rise in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. However, there is indication that the effect of long-term trends in wind speed on leaf gas exchange may be compensated for by the concurrent reduction in mean leaf sizes. These unintuitive feedbacks between wind, leaf size and water use efficiency call for re-evaluation of the role of wind in plant water relations and potential re-interpretation of temporal and geographic trends in leaf sizes.},

We based our analysis on a decade of weather and energy flux measurements, collected over two contrasting landscapes, an oak savanna and an annual grassland, growing under the same climate conditions. Over the decade, the daily-averaged, potential air temperature above the aerodynamically rougher and optically darker oak savanna was 0.5°C warmer than that above the aerodynamically smoother and optically brighter annual grassland. However, air temperature differences were seasonal. Smallest differences in potential air temperature occurred towards the end of spring, when much of the soil moisture reservoir was depleted. Largest differences in potential air temperature occurred during the winter rain season when the grass was green and transpiring and when the trees were senescent or deciduous. To understand the effect of land use on the local climate, we examined the concomitant changes in net radiation, sensible and latent heat exchange, the aerodynamic roughness (Ra), the surface resistance to water transfer (Rs), aerodynamic surface temperature and the growth of the planetary boundary layer, with measurements and model computations. Overall, these biophysical variables provide us with mechanistic information to diagnose and predict how changes in air temperature will follow changes in land use or management. In conclusion, land use change is responsible for having a marked impact on the local climate of a region. At the local level, the change in the surface energy balance, towards a darker and rougher surface, will produce an additive increment to climate warming induced by a greater greenhouse gas burden in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The ADVEX project involved conducting extensive advection measurements at three sites, each with a different topography. One goal of the project was to measure the [CO2] balance under night-time conditions, in an attempt to improve NEE estimates. Four towers were arranged in a square around a main tower, with the sides of the square about 100m long. Equipped with 16 sonic anemometers and [CO2] sampling points, the towers were installed to measure vertical and horizontal advection of [CO2]. Vertical turbulent fluxes were measured by an eddy covariance system at the top of the main tower. The results showed that horizontal advection varied greatly from site to site and from one wind sector to another, the highest values being reached when there were large friction velocities and fairly unstable conditions. There was less variation in vertical advection, the highest values being reached when there were low friction velocities and stable conditions. The night-time NEE estimates deduced from the mass balance were found to be incompatible with biologically driven fluxes because (i) they varied strongly from one wind sector to another and this variation could not be explained in terms of a response of the biologic flux to climate, (ii) their order of magnitude was not realistic and (iii) they still showed a trend vs. friction velocity. From a critical analysis of the measurement and data treatment we concluded that the causes of the problem are related to the representativeness of the measurement (control volume size, sampling resolution) or the hypotheses underlying the derivation of the [CO2] mass balance (ignoring the horizontal turbulent flux divergence). This suggests that the improvement of eddy flux measurements by developing an advection completed [CO2] mass balance at night would be practically difficult.},

	abstract = {We sought to improve net ecosystem exchange (NEE) estimates for a tall, dense, mature Douglas-fir forest in the Oregon Coast range characterized by weak flows, systematic wind directional shear, and limited turbulent mixing throughout the diurnal period. We used eddy covariance (EC) observations at two levels and concurrent biological measurements of carbon and water fluxes collected over a period of 6 years (2006–2011) to develop and test a conceptual framework to (i) reduce uncertainty by retaining more measurements for the computation of annual NEE sums and (ii) produce defendable and biologically meaningful estimates by accounting for the missing sub-canopy respiration. The framework assumes that (a) the scalar exchange between vertical layers can be categorized into discrete canopy coupling regimes and (b) advection leads to a systematic loss of scalar from the observational volume that can indirectly be estimated and accounted for as sub-canopy respiration flux when canopy layers are decoupled. Periods with a decoupled sub-canopy layer dominated and occupied 65 and 88\% of the day- and nighttime periods, respectively. Annual NEE derived from the new framework was estimated as 480gCm−2year−1, which was reduced by 620gCm−2year−1 compared to traditional estimates from single-level EC data filtered using a critical friction velocity. The reduced NEE was due to an enhanced ecosystem respiration (RE), while gross ecosystem productivity remained unchanged. Improved RE estimates agreed well with those from independent estimates based on soil, stem, and foliage respiration within 3\%. Risks and limitations of the new framework are discussed. We conclude that concurrent above- and sub-canopy EC observations are essential to measure a meaningful carbon balance in tall, dense forests since they do no lend themselves to traditional, standardized processing. The new framework may help to include more tall and dense forests in global carbon cycle synthesis and modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Among forest types, the Mediterranean maquis is specifically exposed to fluctuations in water availability. Therefore, monitoring the water-use patterns of its major tree species is key in quantifying the local and regional water balance. However, the traditional measurement methods of tree water-use at high spatial scales are difficult and labor-intensive, thus indirect methods become useful. Evaporation of water from the stomatal pores on the leaf surface involves evaporative cooling, and hence the differences between the leaf temperature and its surrounding air temperature (ΔTleaf-air) can serve as a reliable estimator for tree water-use. Here, we used direct measurement of transpiration rate (E) with a gas exchange system, simultaneously with ground Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) imaging to study the relationship between ΔTleaf-air and E in dominant tree species of the Mediterranean maquis. Controlled experiments were conducted in parallel with measurements in the forest, on five tree species of contrasting leaf shapes (Conifers: Pinus halepensis; Cupressus sempervirens; Broadleaf: simple: Quercus calliprinos; Ceratonia siliqua; compound: Pistacia lentiscus). Next, we used a quantitative approach, applying a leaf energy balance model to estimate E from the TIR images and compared it to the direct measurement of the gas exchange system. We report evaporative cooling across the five species, replicated in tree saplings and in mature trees in the forest. The conifers were significantly cooler than broadleaves by up to ∼4 °C and produced narrower ΔTleaf-air ranges. Estimations of E from ΔTleaf-air were relatively close to the observed E, with some overestimations. Our observations show that TIR imaging can detect transpiration-related differences in ΔTleaf-air among species and can be used to estimate E in natural environments. Yet, the dependence of ΔTleaf-air on E is species-specific and thus, empirical associations must be developed separately for each of the species.},

	abstract = {An upgraded spectral radiation model called SMARTS2 (Simple Model of the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine) is introduced. The solar shortwave direct beam irradiance is calculated from spectral transmittance functions for the main extinction processes in the cloudless atmosphere: Rayleigh scattering, aerosol extinction, and absorption by ozone, uniformly mixed gases, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide. Temperature-dependent or pressure-dependent extinction coefficients have been developed for all these absorbing gases, based on recent spectroscopic data obtained either directly from the experimental literature or, in a preprocessed form, from MODTRAN, a state-of-the-art rigorous code. The NO2 extinction effect, in both the UV and visible, is introduced in detail for the first time in a simple spectral model by taking into account temperature-dependent absorption coefficients. Aerosol extinction is evaluated using a two-tier Ångström approach. Parameterizations of the wavelength exponents and single-scattering coefficient for different aerosol models (proposed by Shettle and Fenn, Braslau and Dave, and also in the Standard Radiation Atmosphere) are provided as a function of both wavelength and relative humidity. Moreover, aerosol turbidity can now be estimated from airport visibility data using a function based on the Shettle and Fenn aerosol model. SMARTS2 also has an optional circumsolar correction function and two filter smoothing functions which together allow the simulation of actual spectroradiometers. This facilitates comparison between modeled results and measured data. Preliminary performance assessment indicates that the direct-beam irradiance predicted by the proposed model compares well to published reference spectra obtained with rigorous radiative codes, and to measured spectroradiometric data.},

The FORTRAN code "Simple Model for Atmospheric Transmission of Sunshine" (SMARTS) was developed for various clear-sky solar renewable energy applications. The model is partly based on parameterizations of transmittance functions in the MODTRAN/LOWTRAN band model family of radiative transfer codes. SMARTS computes spectra with a resolution of 0.5 nanometers (nm) below 400 nm, 1.0 nm from 400 nm to 1700 nm, and 5 nm from 1700 nm to 4000 nm. Fewer than 20 input parameters are required to compute spectral irradiance distributions including spectral direct beam, total, and diffuse hemispherical radiation, and up to 30 other spectral parameters. A spreadsheet-based graphical user interface can be used to simplify the construction of input files for the model. The model is the basis for new terrestrial reference spectra developed by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for photovoltaic and materials degradation applications. We describe the model accuracy, functionality, and the availability of source and executable code. Applications to PV rating and efficiency and the combined effects of spectral selectivity and varying atmospheric conditions are briefly discussed.},

Its derivation uses the same two-band scheme as in the previous CPCR2 model, but with numerous improvements. Great attention is devoted to precisely account for the effect of aerosols, in particular. Detailed research-class measurements from Billings, OK are used to assess the performance of the model for the prediction of direct, diffuse and global broadband irradiance. These measurements were made in May 2003 during a sophisticated radiative closure experiment, which involved the best radiometric instrumentation currently available and many ancillary instruments. As a whole, these exceptional measurements constitute the only known modern benchmark dataset made specifically to test the intrinsic performance of radiation models. Using this dataset as reference, it is shown that REST2 performs better than CPCR2 for irradiance, illuminance or PAR predictions. The availability of the turbidity data required by REST2 or other similar models is also discussed, as well as the effect that turbidity has on each component of broadband irradiance, PAR irradiance and illuminance, and on the diffuse/global PAR ratio.},

At the same time, regional weather modification methods, like cloud seeding, are being used to counteract increasing water scarcity in arid regions. Large-scale sustainable desert agroforestry plantations can contribute to climate change mitigation and can also be used to modify regional climate, particularly rainfall. Climate impacts from plantations need to be well understood before considering implementation. Typically, impact studies are attempted at continental or global scales and use coarse-resolution models, which suffer from severe systematic errors. This is highly problematic because decision makers should only countenance geoengineering schemes like global afforestation if impacts are understood on the regional scale. We posit the necessity of using high-resolution regional models with sophisticated representations of land–atmosphere feedback and vegetation. This approach allows for studying desert plantations and the process chain leading to climate modification. We demonstrate that large-scale plantations enhance regional clouds and rainfall and derive an index for predicting plantation impacts. Thus, desert plantations represent a unique environmental solution via predictable regional weather modification and carbon storage.},

But the overall impact of forestation on climate will also depend on other effects associated with the creation of new forests. In particular, the albedo of a forested landscape is generally lower than that of cultivated land, especially when snow is lying, and decreasing albedo exerts a positive radiative forcing on climate. Here I simulate the radiative forcings associated with changes in surface albedo as a result of forestation in temperate and boreal forest areas, and translate these forcings into equivalent changes in local carbon stock for comparison with estimated carbon sequestration potentials. I suggest that in many boreal forest areas, the positive forcing induced by decreases in albedo can offset the negative forcing that is expected from carbon sequestration. Some high-latitude forestation activities may therefore increase climate change, rather than mitigating it as intended.},

	abstract = {In arid/semi-arid ecosystems, biological resources, such as water, soil nutrients, and plant biomass, typically go through periods of high and low abundance. Short periods of high resource abundance are usually triggered by rainfall events, which, despite of the overall scarcity of rain, can saturate the resource demand of some biological processes for a time. This review develops the idea that there exists a hierarchy of soil moisture pulse events with a corresponding hierarchy of ecological responses, such that small pulses only trigger a small number of relatively minor ecological events, and larger pulses trigger a more inclusive set and some larger ecological events. This framework hinges on the observation that many biological state changes, where organisms transition from a state of lower to higher physiological activity, require a minimal triggering event size. Response thresholds are often determined by the ability of organisms to utilize soil moisture pulses of different infiltration depth or duration. For example, brief, shallow pulses can only affect surface dwelling organisms with fast response times and high tolerance for low resource levels, such as some species of the soil micro-fauna and -flora, while it takes more water and deeper infiltration to affect the physiology, growth or reproduction of higher plants. This review first discusses how precipitation, climate and site factors translate into soil moisture pulses of varying magnitude and duration. Next, the idea of the response hierarchy for ecosystem processes is developed, followed by an exploration of the possible evolutionary background for the existence of response thresholds to resource pulses. The review concludes with an outlook on global change: does the hierarchical view of precipitation effects in ecosystems provide new perspectives on the future of arid/semiarid lands?},

The presence of this pathway for the movement of gases also results in water loss from the hydrated surfaces within leaves to the atmosphere. Stomatal aperture appears to be controlled by complex mechanisms which operate to maintain a variable balance between allowing CO2 uptake to proceed, while restricting the loss of water vapor, and preventing leaf desiccation. Recent reviews have examined the physiological bases of stomatal function (Raschke 1979; Allaway and Milthorpe 1976) and stomatal responses to environment (Sheriff 1979; Burrows and Milthorpe 1976; Hall et al. 1976). Analyses which integrated stomatal effects on CO2 exchange, transpiration, and energy balance were developed based upon theory (Cowan 1977), which have led to hypotheses concerning optimal stomatal function (see Chap. 17, this Vol.; Cowan and Farquhar 1977). However, information concerning the simultaneous responses of stomata, water loss, and CO2 assimilation rates has not been reviewed for plants in natural environments.},

Hydraulic constraints on plant carbohydrate use determined survival time: turgor loss in the phloem limited access to carbohydrate reserves, but hydraulic control of respiration prolonged survival.

Plant water and carbon relations are interdependent and assessments of their individual contributions are difficult. Because drought always affects both plant hydration and carbon assimilation, it is challenging to disentangle their concomitant effects on carbon balance and carbon translocation. Here, we report results of a manipulation experiment specifically designed to separate drought effects on carbon and water relations from those on carbon translocation.

* In a glasshouse experiment, we manipulated the carbon balance of Norway spruce saplings exposed to either drought or carbon starvation (CO2 withdrawal), or both treatments, and compared the dynamics of carbon exchange, allocation and storage in different tissues.

* Drought killed trees much faster than did carbon starvation. Storage C pools were not depleted at death for droughted trees as they were for starved, well-watered trees. Hence drought has a significant detrimental effect on a plant's ability to utilize stored carbon.

* Unless they can be transported to where they are needed, sufficient carbon reserves alone will not assure survival of a drought except under specific conditions, such as moderate drought, or in species that maintain plant water relations required for carbon re-mobilization.},

	abstract = {Understanding physiological processes involved in drought-induced mortality is important for predicting the future of forests and for modelling the carbon and water cycles. Recent research has highlighted the variable risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure in drought-exposed trees. However, little is known about the specific responses of leaves and supporting twigs, despite their critical role in balancing carbon acquisition and water loss. Comparing healthy (non-defoliated) and unhealthy (defoliated) Scots pine at the same site, we measured the physiological variables involved in regulating carbon and water resources. Defoliated trees showed different responses to summer drought compared with non-defoliated trees. Defoliated trees maintained gas exchange while non-defoliated trees reduced photosynthesis and transpiration during the drought period. At the branch scale, very few differences were observed in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations between health classes. However, defoliated trees tended to have lower water potentials and smaller hydraulic safety margins. While non-defoliated trees showed a typical response to drought for an isohydric species, the physiology appears to be driven in defoliated trees by the need to maintain carbon resources in twigs. These responses put defoliated trees at higher risk of branch hydraulic failure and help explain the interaction between carbon starvation and hydraulic failure in dying trees.},

	abstract = {Stomatal regulation of leaf gas exchange with the atmosphere is a key process in plant adaptation to the environment, particularly in semi-arid regions with high atmospheric evaporative demand. Development of stomata, integrating internal signaling and environmental cues sets the limit for maximum diffusive capacity of stomata, through size and density and is under a complex genetic control, thus providing multiple levels of regulation. Operational stomatal conductance to water vapor and CO2 results from feed-back and/or feed-forward mechanisms and is the end-result of a plethora of signals originated in leaves and/or in roots at each moment. CO2 assimilation versus water vapor loss, proposed to be the subject of optimal regulation, is species dependent and defines the water use efficiency (WUE). WUE has been a topic of intense research involving areas from genetics to physiology. In crop plants, especially in semi-arid regions, the question that arises is how the compromise of reducing transpiration to save water will impact on plant performance through leaf temperature. Indeed, plant transpiration by providing evaporative cooling, is a major component of the leaf energy balance. In this paper we discuss the dilemma of ‘saving water or being cool’ bringing about recent findings from molecular genetics, to development and physiology of stomata. The question of ‘how relevant is screening for high/low WUE in crops for semi-arid regions, where drought and heat co-occur’ is discussed.},

Much less is known about the magnitude of the energy flows within the climate system and at the Earth surface, which cannot be directly measured by satellites. In addition to satellite observations, here we make extensive use of the growing number of surface observations to constrain the global energy balance not only from space, but also from the surface. We combine these observations with the latest modeling efforts performed for the 5th IPCC assessment report to infer best estimates for the global mean surface radiative components. Our analyses favor global mean downward surface solar and thermal radiation values near 185 and 342 Wm−2, respectively, which are most compatible with surface observations. Combined with an estimated surface absorbed solar radiation and thermal emission of 161 and 397 Wm−2, respectively, this leaves 106 Wm−2 of surface net radiation available globally for distribution amongst the non-radiative surface energy balance components. The climate models overestimate the downward solar and underestimate the downward thermal radiation, thereby simulating nevertheless an adequate global mean surface net radiation by error compensation. This also suggests that, globally, the simulated surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, around 20 and 85 Wm−2 on average, state realistic values. The findings of this study are compiled into a new global energy balance diagram, which may be able to reconcile currently disputed inconsistencies between energy and water cycle estimates.},

	abstract = {Summary Plant canopies are characterized by extensive gradients in light availability that importantly alter the photosynthetic productivity of leaves in different canopy layers and result in acclimatory changes in leaf structural, chemical and physiological traits. These within-canopy variations are further importantly driven by species functional type and ecological characteristics such as shade tolerance (ecological controls). This chapter explores the within-canopy variations in key functional traits among different plant functional types and in species with different ecological potentials using a simple methodology to separate the importance of different leaf-level traits in foliage photosynthetic acclimation. As a major acclimatory change, foliage photosynthetic capacity per leaf area (A max A) increases with increasing long-term average integrated quantum flux density (Q int) in the canopy. Within-canopy variation in A max A results in a greater whole canopy carbon gain than having A max A constant through the canopy. The increase in A max A with Q int can potentially result from increases in leaf dry mass per unit area (M A), nitrogen content per unit dry mass (N M) and nitrogen allocation to rate-limiting photosynthetic proteins. This analysis indicates that the importance of these three key factors varies among plant functional types. In species with relatively low rates of canopy expansion and leaf turnover such as woody evergreens and woody deciduous species, within-canopy variation in A max A is primarily determined by M A, while in herbaceous species with high rates of canopy growth and leaf turnover, the variation is mainly driven by changes in N M and nitrogen allocation to rate-limiting proteins of photosynthetic machinery. Furthermore, there are large within-canopy modifications in structural traits such as leaf angles and spatial aggregation modulating light harvesting and light avoidance, and in chemical traits such as xanthophyll cycle carotenoid content and isoprene emission contributing to abiotic stress resistance. As the result of light-dependent alterations in these traits, lower canopy leaves have a greater light harvesting efficiency, while upper canopy leaves a greater capacity for excess radiation dissipation and resistance to abiotic stress. Plasticity for foliar modifications varies among woody species of different ecological potentials with shade-intolerant species tending to have a greater photosynthetic plasticity, while shade-tolerant species greater leaf areas and higher canopy light interception. This review emphasizes the overall large within-canopy variation in key foliage functional traits and underscores the important differences among plant functional types and in species with different ecological potentials in their acclimation to within-canopy environment.},

	abstract = {* Forest microclimate is crucial for the growth and survival of tree seedlings and understorey vegetation. This high ecological relevance contrasts with the poor functional and quantitative understanding of how the properties of forest ecosystems influence forest microclimate.


* In a long-term (1998–2011) trial, we investigated how temporal patterns of microclimate below sparse and dense forest canopy related to those of nearby open areas and how this relationship was influenced by soil moisture and seasonality. Air temperature (T), vapour pressure deficit (VPD), soil matrix potential and leaf area index (LAI) were measured in a unique set-up of below-canopy and open-area meteorological stations at eleven distinct forest ecosystems, characteristic of subalpine and temperate climate zones. Data from these plots were analysed for the moderating capacity of the canopy, that is, the differences between below-canopy and open-area microclimate, with respect to (i) long-term means, (ii) dynamics within homogeneous moist- vs. dry-soil periods and (iii) diurnal patterns.


* The long-term mean moderating capacity of the canopy was up to 3.3 °C for daily Tmax and 0.52 kPa for daily VPDmax, of which soil moisture status alone accounted for up to 1.2 °C (Tmax) and 0.21 kPa (VPDmax). Below dense canopy (LAI {\textgreater} 4), the moderating capacity was generally higher when soils were dry and increased during dry-soil periods, particularly in spring and somewhat less in summer. The opposite pattern was found below sparse canopy (LAI {\textless} 4). At the diurnal level, moderating capacity below dense canopy was strongest in mid-afternoon and during dry-soil conditions, whereas peak moderation below sparse canopy occurred in mid-morning and during moist-soil conditions.


* Synthesis. Our results suggest a threshold canopy density, which is probably linked to site-specific water availability, below which the moderating capacity of forest ecosystems switches from supportive to unsupportive for seedling establishment. Under supportive moderating capacity, we understand a stronger mitigation during physiologically most demanding conditions for plant growth. Such a threshold canopy density sheds new light on forest resilience to climate change. Climate change may alter forest canopy density in a way that precludes successful establishment of tree species and ultimately changes forest ecosystem structure and functioning.},

	abstract = {Large-scale biogeographical shifts in vegetation are predicted in response to the altered precipitation and temperature regimes associated with global climate change. Vegetation shifts have profound ecological impacts and are an important climate-ecosystem feedback through their alteration of carbon, water, and energy exchanges of the land surface. Of particular concern is the potential for warmer temperatures to compound the effects of increasingly severe droughts by triggering widespread vegetation shifts via woody plant mortality. The sensitivity of tree mortality to temperature is dependent on which of 2 non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms predominates—temperature-sensitive carbon starvation in response to a period of protracted water stress or temperature-insensitive sudden hydraulic failure under extreme water stress (cavitation). Here we show that experimentally induced warmer temperatures (≈4 °C) shortened the time to drought-induced mortality in Pinus edulis (piñon shortened pine) trees by nearly a third, with temperature-dependent differences in cumulative respiration costs implicating carbon starvation as the primary mechanism of mortality. Extrapolating this temperature effect to the historic frequency of water deficit in the southwestern United States predicts a 5-fold increase in the frequency of regional-scale tree die-off events for this species due to temperature alone. Projected increases in drought frequency due to changes in precipitation and increases in stress from biotic agents (e.g., bark beetles) would further exacerbate mortality. Our results demonstrate the mechanism by which warmer temperatures have exacerbated recent regional die-off events and background mortality rates. Because of pervasive projected increases in temperature, our results portend widespread increases in the extent and frequency of vegetation die-off.},

	abstract = {Leaf transpiration rate (E) frequently shows a peaked response to increasing vapour pressure deficit (D). The mechanisms for the decrease in E at high D, known as the ‘apparent feed-forward response’, are strongly debated but explanations to date have exclusively focused on hydraulic processes. However, stomata also respond to signals related to photosynthesis. We investigated whether the apparent feed-forward response of E to D in the field can be explained by the response of photosynthesis to temperature (T), which normally co-varies with D in field conditions. As photosynthesis decreases with increasing T past its optimum, it may drive a decrease in stomatal conductance (gs) that is additional to the response of gs to increasing D alone. If this additional decrease is sufficiently steep and coupling between A and gs occurs, it could cause an overall decrease in E with increasing D. We tested this mechanism using a gas exchange model applied to leaf-scale and whole-tree CO2 and H2O fluxes measured on Eucalyptus saligna growing in whole-tree chambers. A peaked response of E to D was observed at both leaf and whole-tree scales. We found that this peaked response was matched by a gas exchange model only when T effects on photosynthesis were incorporated. We conclude that field-based studies of the relationship between E and D need to consider signals related to changing photosynthetic rates in addition to purely hydraulic mechanisms.},

The nonlinear response of photosynthesis to meteorological variables makes the temporal scaling a significant challenge. In this study, two temporal upscaling schemes of daily photosynthesis, the integrated daily model (IDM) and the segmented daily model (SDM), are presented by considering the diurnal variations of meteorological variables based on a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model. The two models, as well as a simple average daily model (SADM) with daily average meteorological inputs, were validated using the tower-derived gross primary production (GPP) to assess their abilities in simulating daily photosynthesis. The results showed IDM closely followed the seasonal trend of the tower-derived GPP with an average RMSE of 1.63 g C m−2 day−1, and an average Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) of 0.87. SDM performed similarly to IDM in GPP simulation but decreased the computation time by {\textgreater}66 \%. SADM overestimated daily GPP by about 15 \% during the growing season compared to IDM. Both IDM and SDM greatly decreased the overestimation by SADM, and improved the simulation of daily GPP by reducing the RMSE by 34 and 30 \%, respectively. The results indicated that IDM and SDM are useful temporal upscaling approaches, and both are superior to SADM in daily GPP simulation because they take into account the diurnally varying responses of photosynthesis to meteorological variables. SDM is computationally more efficient, and therefore more suitable for long-term and large-scale GPP simulations.},

Biogeophysical attributes, such as surface albedo (reflectivity), further control the climate-regulating properties of forests. Using both tower-based and remotely sensed data sets, we show that natural disturbances from wildfire, beetle outbreaks, and hurricane wind throw can significantly alter surface albedo, and the associated radiative forcing either offsets or enhances the CO2 forcing caused by reducing ecosystem carbon sequestration over multiple years. In the examined cases, the radiative forcing from albedo change is on the same order of magnitude as the CO2 forcing. The net radiative forcing resulting from these two factors leads to a local heating effect in a hurricane-damaged mangrove forest in the subtropics, and a cooling effect following wildfire and mountain pine beetle attack in boreal forests with winter snow. Although natural forest disturbances currently represent less than half of gross forest cover loss, that area will probably increase in the future under climate change, making it imperative to represent these processes accurately in global climate models.},

	abstract = {Natural peatlands accumulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). They affect the global climate by binding carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing methane (CH4) to the atmosphere; in contrast fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) in natural peatlands are insignificant. Changes in drainage associated with forestry alter these greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and thus the radiative forcing (RF) of peatlands. In this paper, changes in peat and tree stand C stores, GHG fluxes and the consequent RF of Finnish undisturbed and forestry-drained peatlands are estimated for 1900–2100. The C store in peat is estimated at 5.5 Pg in 1950. The rate of C sequestration into peat has increased from 2.2 Tg a--1 in 1900, when all peatlands were undrained, to 3.6 Tg a--1 at present, when c. 60\% of peatlands have been drained for forestry. The C store in tree stands has increased from 60 to 170 Tg during the 20th century. Methane emissions have decreased from an estimated 1.0–0.5 Tg CH4--C a--1, while those of N2O have increased from 0.0003 to 0.005 Tg N2O--N a--1. The altered exchange rates of GHG gases since 1900 have decreased the RF of peatlands in Finland by about 3 mW m--2 from the predrainage situation. This result contradicts the common hypothesis that drainage results in increased C emissions and therefore increased RF of peatlands. The negative radiative forcing due to drainage is caused by increases in CO2 sequestration in peat (--0.5 mW m--2), tree stands and wood products (--0.8 mW m--2), decreases in CH4 emissions from peat to the atmosphere (--1.6 mW m--2), and only a small increase in N2O emissions (+0.1 mW m--2). Although the calculations presented include many uncertainties, the above results are considered qualitatively reliable and may be expected to be valid also for Scandinavian countries and Russia, where most forestry-drained peatlands occur outside Finland.},

None of the annual cropping systems provided net mitigation, although soil carbon accumulation in no-till systems came closest to mitigating all other sources of GWP.

In most coniferous species the canopy layer is well separated from the understorey and several cohorts of needles coexist. It was therefore found necessary to distinguish several vegetation layers and, in each layer, several leaf classes defined not only by their light regime and wetness status but also by their age. This model, named MuSICA, is a multilayer, multileaf process-based model. Each submodel is first independently parameterized using data collected at a EUROFLUX site near Bordeaux (Southwestern France). Particular care is brought to identify the seasonal variations in the various physiological parameters. The full model is then evaluated using a two-year long data set, split up into 12 day-type classes defined by the season, the weather type and the soil water status. Beyond the good overall agreement obtained between measured and modelled values at various time scales, several points of further improvement are identified. They concern the seasonal variations in the stomatal response of needles and the soil/litter respiration, as well as their interaction with soil or litter moisture. A sensitivity analysis to some of the model features (in-canopy turbulent transfer scheme, leaf age classes, water retention, distinction between shaded and sunlit leaves, number of layers) is finally performed in order to evaluate whether significant simplifications can be brought to such a model with little loss in its predictive quality. The distinction between several leaf classes is crucial if one is to compute biospheric fluxes accurately. It is also evidenced that accounting for in-canopy turbulent transfer leads to better estimates of the sensible heat flux.},

	abstract = {An analytical one-dimensional second-order closure model is developed to describe the within canopy velocity variances, turbulent intensities, dissipation rates, Lagrangian time scale and Lagrangian far field diffusivities for vegetation canopies of arbitrary structure and density. The model incorporates and extends the model of momentum transfer developed by Massman (1997) and the model of within canopy velocity variances developed by Weil (unpublished) from the second-order closure model of Wilson and Shaw (1977). Model predictions of within and above canopy velocity variances, turbulent intensities, dissipation rates and the Lagrangian time scale are in reasonable agreement with previously measured or estimated values for these parameters. The present model suggests that the Lagrangian time scale and the far field diffusivity could be strongly dependent upon foliage structure and density through the foliage effects on the velocity variances. A simple formulation for the Lagrangian time scale at canopy height is derived from model results. Taken as a whole, the present model may provide a relatively simple way to incorporate turbulence parameters into models of soil/canopy/atmosphere mass transfer.},

	abstract = {Environmental controls of stand-level tree transpiration (E) and seasonal patterns of soil water utilization were studied in five central Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) sites differing in tree density. Tree density of Cerrado vegetation in the study area consistently changes along topographic gradients from ∼1000 trees ha−1 in open savannas (campo sujo) at the lower end of the topographic gradient to \&gt;3000 trees ha−1 in woodlands (cerradão) at the upper end of the gradient. Tree canopy resistance (rC) increased linearly with increasing daily mean air saturation deficit (D) at all sites, but cerradão and cerrado denso sites with higher tree density and higher tree leaf area index (LAI) had lower rC values at all values of D compared to physiognomies with lower tree density, suggesting that rC was less sensitive to changes in D in physiognomies with high tree density and LAI. During the peak of the dry season, mean soil water potential at 0.20 m depth was most negative in the sites with the lowest tree basal area and increased linearly with basal area across sites. In contrast, soil water storage in the 0.10–2.50 m layer decreased exponentially with increasing basal area, consistent with trees in higher density sites utilizing a larger proportion of available soil water at depth during the dry season. Maximum tree transpiration was highest in the cerradão and cerrado denso (∼0.81 mm day−1). Despite higher evaporative demand during the dry season, E was similar between the dry and wet seasons within each study site, which was associated with lower LAI and canopy conductance (gC) during the dry season compared to the wet season. Leaf area index was a good predictor of E and gC. For both dry and wet season data combined, E increased asymptotically with increasing LAI across all physiognomic types, allowing LAI to be used as a predictor of spatial variation of E. The lack of seasonality in E across the Cerrado physiognomies studied could not be explained by individual constraining variables such as D or soil water potential near the surface, but was consistent with the influence of multiple regulatory effects of D and soil water potential on seasonal changes in leaf area and gC.},

	abstract = {Tropical savannas including those of central Brazil (Cerrado) serve as an important regulator of energy and mass exchange with the atmosphere. However, the effects of interactions between grasses and deeply rooted trees and shrubs on energy and water fluxes of savannas are not well understood. In this study, eddy-covariance measurements were used to observe and compare the energy balance and evapotranspiration at two adjacent Cerrado sites differing in woody plant density.

Latent energy flux (LE) and evapotranspiration (ET) for Cerrado Denso (8–10-m trees with a cover density of approximately 50\% and an understory of grass and shrubs) were generally similar to or greater than for Campo Cerrado (widely scattered 3–4-m trees with a cover density of about 5\% and an understory of grasses, shrubs, and sedges), with the greatest difference between the sites occurring during the dry season. Mean annual ET was 823 and 689 mm yr−1, and LE averaged 63.9 ± 11.7 and 53.5 ± 14.3 W m−2 at Cerrado Denso and Campo Cerrado, respectively. At both sites, ET reached a minimum at near the end of the dry season, indicating that reduced water availability constrained dry season ET at both sites. The Bowen ratio at both sites increased as soil moisture decreased, but with a stronger dependency at the Campo Cerrado site, presumably due to the dominance of shallow-rooted plants and the larger contribution of soil evaporation there. Energy partitioning, as indicated by the Bowen ratio, was also strongly influenced by variations in leaf area index (LAI). The strong similarity in the Bowen ratio–LAI relationship for the two sites suggests that LAI can be used to explain much of the observed temporal and spatial ET variability across seasons and variations in woody plant density in the Cerrado.},

Photoinhibitory changes in maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) could be explained solely from a parameter (Lflux) calculated from the light micro-environment of the leaves. This relationship between Fv/Fm and the intercepted cumulative light dose, integrated and equally weighted over several hours was incorporated into the model. The effect of photoinhibition on net photosynthesis was described through relationships between photoinhibition and the shaping parameters of the photosynthetic light-response curve (quantum use efficiency, convexity, and maximum capacity). This new aspect of the model was then validated by comparing measured field data (diurnal courses of Fv/Fm) with simulation results. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the extent of photoinhibitory reduction of whole-plant photosynthesis was strongly dependent on the structural parameters (LAI and leaf angle). Simulations for a Mediterranean evergreen oak, Quercus coccifera, under climatic conditions which cause mild photoinhibition revealed a daily loss of 7·5–8·5\% of potential carbon gain in the upper sunlit canopy layers, a 3\% loss in the bottom canopy, and an overall loss of 6·1\%. Thus, this canopy photoinhibition model (CANO-PI) allows the quantitative evaluation of photoinhibition effects on primary production.},

	abstract = {Orchards and many other land surface types have vegetation that does not completely cover the underlying ground surface. For these land surfaces there are at least two distinct and interacting surface components, the overstorey/canopy and the understorey/ground. Independent measurement of energy fluxes from each component is an important step toward understanding the factors controlling the resultant overhead flux. In this study, we evaluated flux measurement methods in a sheltered lemon orchard where the canopy of the lemon trees covered 39\% of the orchard floor. Lemon tree transpiration was measured using the stem heat balance method with branch measurements scaled up to canopy level. These measurements compared well with Penman–Monteith transpiration. For the understorey, the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes measured by eddy correlation was equal to available energy. Eddy correlation and Bowen ratio methods of flux measurement also compared well in the understorey. However, at the height of the shelters above the orchard we observed an inconsistency between eddy correlation and Bowen ratio methods which suggested that the latter method is unreliable at this location. Flux measurement and interpretation in an orchard can be complicated by the presence of windbreaks or shelters. In particular, the source area for fluxes above a sheltered orchard may include the shelter trees and adjacent orchard blocks. Our orchard block (42 m × 124 m) was surrounded by shelter trees 8 m high and differed from the surrounding blocks in that the understorey was bare rather than covered in grass. This difference enabled us to examine the likely source area contributing to our measurements. Good agreement was found between eddy fluxes measured at 8 m (above the orchard) and the sum of the component fluxes from within the orchard block. Our analysis indicated that the source area for fluxes measured at 8 m is largely within the orchard block studied.},

Understanding how trees affect their understorey plants and soils is crucial to understand savanna ecosystems. Most studies focus on the differences between canopy and open microsites, but how do different positions within large tree canopies influence soils and plants? Are these potential differences likely to change depending on environmental conditions (i.e. annual rainfall and grazing)?


Location

One hundred sites across a rainfall gradient (220–1400 mm) in NSW, Australia.


Methods

We measured the cover, richness and community composition of understorey plants and 12 soil attributes related to infiltration, erodibility and fertility across three positions within the canopy of large eucalypts (trunk, mid-canopy and edge) and in open areas. We also estimated the percentage similarity in plant communities across microsites, and the percentage species within the landscape occurring solely in one of the four microsites assayed. We tested the interactions between the effect of environmental conditions (rainfall and grazing) and canopy position on all these soil and vegetation attributes.


Results

Soil attributes explained {\textasciitilde}50\% of the effect of trees on understorey plants, and soil attributes improved with proximity to the trunk and increasing rainfall. The effect of canopy position × rainfall interactions depended on the response variable considered. These interactions did not affect soil attributes, the percentage of facilitation-obligate species or species richness, and weakly affected plant composition. However, we found a strong reduction in similarity among plant communities within edge and mid-canopy compared with open sites towards drier environments, and canopy position × rainfall interactions also significantly affected plant cover. We attribute these weak interactions between canopy position and environmental conditions to richness or the frequency of facilitation to the high turnover of facilitated species across microsites and across different environmental conditions.


Conclusions

Our study can be used to better understand community dynamics in ecosystems with scattered trees by showing the differential effects of trees on their understorey. Our results also contribute to the body of research on the relationships between plant–plant interactions and the environment by illustrating the importance of gradient length and the number of different microsites considered.},

	abstract = {Global estimates of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) remain highly uncertain, despite decades of satellite measurements and intensive in situ monitoring. We report a new approach for quantifying the near-infrared reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRV). NIRV provides a foundation for a new approach to estimate GPP that consistently untangles the confounding effects of background brightness, leaf area, and the distribution of photosynthetic capacity with depth in canopies using existing moderate spatial and spectral resolution satellite sensors. NIRV is strongly correlated with solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, a direct index of photons intercepted by chlorophyll, and with site-level and globally gridded estimates of GPP. NIRV makes it possible to use existing and future reflectance data as a starting point for accurately estimating GPP.
Quantifying the near-infrared light reflected by plant canopies improves our ability to estimate global photosynthesis.

	abstract = {The challenge of partitioning energy and evapotranspiration (ET) components was addressed over a season (bud break till harvest) in a wine grape vineyard located in an extreme arid region. A below canopy energy balance approach was applied to continuously estimate evaporation from the soil (E) while system ET was measured using eddy covariance. Below canopy energy balance was assessed at the dry midrow position as well as the wet irrigated position directly underneath the vine row, with E calculated as the residual of measured net radiation, soil heat flux, and computed sensible heat flux. The variables used to compute sensible heat flux included soil surface temperature measured using infrared thermometers and below-canopy wind speed in a soil resistance formulation that required a modified wind factor. The E derived from below canopy energy balance was reasonable at daily intervals although it underestimated micro-lysimeter E measurements, suggesting there may have been advected energy from the midrow to the below-vine position. Seasonal partitioning indicated that total E amounted to 9–11\% of ET. In addition, empirical functions from the literature relating crop coefficients (Kcb) to plant size, appeared to give reasonable results under full canopy, albeit with some day to day variation, but underestimated Kcb during the growing period.},

Mean vertical profiles of wind velocity derived from the output are realistic in their shape and response to forest density. Similarly, vertical profiles of Reynolds stress, turbulent kinetic energy and velocity skewness match observations, at least in a qualitative sense. The limited vertical extent of the domain and the artificial upper boundary, however, cause some departures from measured turbulence profiles in real forests. Instantaneous turbulent velocity and scalar fields are presented which show some of the features obtained by tower instrumentation in the field and in wind tunnels, such as the vertical coherence of vertical velocity and the slope of structures revealed by temperature patterns.},

	abstract = {Sonic anemometers simultaneously measure the turbulent fluctuations of vertical wind (w') and sonic temperature (Ts'), and are commonly used to measure sensible heat flux (H). Our study examines 30-min heat fluxes measured with a Campbell Scientific CSAT3 sonic anemometer above a subalpine forest. We compared H calculated with Ts to H calculated with a co-located thermocouple and found that, for horizontal wind speed (U) less than 8 m s−1, the agreement was around ±30 W m−2. However, for U ≈ 8 m s−1, the CSAT H had a generally positive deviation from H calculated with the thermocouple, reaching a maximum difference of ≈250 W m−2 at U ≈ 18 m s−1. With version 4 of the CSAT firmware, we found significant underestimation of the speed of sound and thus Ts in high winds (due to a delayed detection of the sonic pulse), which resulted in the large CSAT heat flux errors. Although this Ts error is qualitatively similar to the well-known fundamental correction for the crosswind component, it is quantitatively different and directly related to the firmware estimation of the pulse arrival time. For a CSAT running version 3 of the firmware, there does not appear to be a significant underestimation of Ts; however, a Ts error similar to that of version 4 may occur if the CSAT is sufficiently out of calibration. An empirical correction to the CSAT heat flux that is consistent with our conceptual understanding of the Ts error is presented. Within a broader context, the surface energy balance is used to evaluate the heat flux measurements, and the usefulness of side-by-side instrument comparisons is discussed.},

To achieve this goal, conventional invariant analysis is extended to allow scalewise information about relaxation to isotropy in physical (instead of Fourier) space to be incorporated. The proposed analysis shows that the CSL is more isotropic than its ASL counterpart at large, intermediate, and small (or inertial) scales irrespective of the thermal stratification. Moreover, the small (or inertial) scale anisotropy is more prevalent in the ASL when compared to the CSL, a finding that cannot be fully explained by the intensity of the mean velocity gradient acting on all scales. Implications to the validity of scalewise Rotta and Lumley models for return to isotropy as well as advantages to using barycentric instead of anisotropy invariant maps for such scalewise analysis are discussed.},

	abstract = {Net uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) was observed during the winter when using the eddy covariance (EC) technique above a ∼90-year-old Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stand in northern Sweden. This uptake occurred despite photosynthetic dormancy. This discrepancy led us to investigate the potential impact of decoupling of below- and above-canopy air mass flow and accompanying below-canopy horizontal advection on these measurements. We used the correlation of above- and below-canopy standard deviation of vertical wind speed (σw), derived from EC measurements above and below the canopy, as the main mixing criterion. We identified 0.33ms−1 and 0.06ms−1 as site-specific σw thresholds for above and below canopy, respectively, to reach the fully coupled state. Decoupling was observed in 45\% of all cases during the measurement period (5.11.2014–25.2.2015). After filtering out decoupled periods the above-canopy mean winter NEE shifted from −0.52μmolm−2s−1 to a more reasonable positive value of 0.31μmolm−2s−1. None of the above-canopy data filtering criteria we tested (i.e., friction velocity threshold; horizontal wind speed threshold; single-level σw threshold) ensured sufficient mixing. All missed critical periods that were detected only by the two-level filtering approach. Tower-surrounding topography induced a predominant below-canopy wind direction and consequent wind shear between above- and below-canopy air masses. These processes may foster decoupling and below-canopy removal of CO2 rich air. To determine how broadly such a topographical influence might apply, we compared the topography surrounding our tower to that surrounding other forest flux sites worldwide. Medians of maximum elevation differences within 300m and 1000m around 110 FLUXNET forest EC towers were 24m and 66m, respectively, compared to 24m and 114m, respectively, at our site. Consequently, below-canopy flow may influence above-canopy NEE detections at many forested EC sites. Based on our findings we suggest below-canopy measurements as standard procedure at sites evaluating forest CO2 budgets.},

	abstract = {We quantify the maximum possible influence of vegetation on the global climate by conducting two extreme climate model simulations: in a first simulation (‘desert world’), values representative of a desert are used for the land surface parameters for all non glaciated land regions. At the other extreme, a second simulation is performed (‘green planet’) in which values are used which are most beneficial for the biosphere's productivity. Land surface evapotranspiration more than triples in the presence of the ‘green planet’, land precipitation doubles (as a second order effect) and near surface temperatures are lower by as much as 8 K in the seasonal mean resulting from the increase in latent heat flux. The differences can be understood in terms of more absorbed radiation at the surface and increased recycling of water. Most of the increase in net surface radiation originates from less thermal radiative loss and not from increases in solar radiation which would be expected from the albedo change. To illustrate the differences in climatic character and what it would imply for the vegetation type, we use the Köppen climate classification. Both cases lead to similar classifications in the extra tropics and South America indicating that the character of the climate is not substantially altered in these regions. Fundamental changes occur over Africa, South Asia and Australia, where large regions are classified as arid (grassland/desert) climate in the ‘desert world’ simulation while classified as a forest climate in the ‘green planet’ simulation as a result of the strong influence of maximum vegetation on the climate. This implies that these regions are especially sensitive to biosphere-atmosphere interaction.},

We have therefore investigated whether black robes help the Bedouins to minimise solar heat loads in a hot desert. This seemed possible because experiments have shown that white hair on cattle1,2 and white feathers on pigeons3 permit greater penetration of short-wave radiation to the skin than black. In fact, more heat flowed inward through white pigeon plumage than through black when both were exposed to simulated solar radiation at wind speeds greater than 3 m s−1 (ref. 3). We report here that the amount of heat gained by a Bedouin exposed to the hot desert is the same whether he wears a black or a white robe. The additional heat absorbed by the black robe was lost before it reached the skin.},

	abstract = {Global change is characterized by increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, increasing average temperature and more frequent extreme events including drought periods, heat waves and flooding. Especially the impacts of drought and of elevated temperature on carbon assimilation are considered in this review. Effects of extreme events on the subcellular level as well as on the whole plant level may be reversible, partially reversible or irreversible. The photosynthetically active biomass depends on the number and the size of mature leaves and the photosynthetic activity in this biomass during stress and subsequent recovery phases. The total area of active leaves is determined by leaf expansion and senescence, while net photosynthesis per leaf area is primarily influenced by stomatal opening (stomatal conductance), mesophyll conductance, activity of the photosynthetic apparatus (light absorption and electron transport, activity of the Calvin cycle) and CO2 release by decarboxylation reactions (photorespiration, dark respiration). Water status, stomatal opening and leaf temperature represent a “magic triangle” of three strongly interacting parameters. The response of stomata to altered environmental conditions is important for stomatal limitations. Rubisco protein is quite thermotolerant, but the enzyme becomes at elevated temperature more rapidly inactivated (decarbamylation, reversible effect) and must be reactivated by Rubisco activase (carbamylation of a lysine residue). Rubisco activase is present under two forms (encoded by separate genes or products of alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA from one gene) and is very thermosensitive. Rubisco activase was identified as a key protein for photosynthesis at elevated temperature (non-stomatal limitation). During a moderate heat stress Rubisco activase is reversibly inactivated, but during a more severe stress (higher temperature and/or longer exposure) the protein is irreversibly inactivated, insolubilized and finally degraded. On the level of the leaf, this loss of photosynthetic activity may still be reversible when new Rubisco activase is produced by protein synthesis. Rubisco activase as well as enzymes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species or in osmoregulation are considered as important targets for breeding crop plants which are still productive under drought and/or at elevated leaf temperature in a changing climate.},

Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year–1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties.

A basic validation of the reference simulation along with a brief discussion of the surface climate changes for the A2 and B2 scenarios is also provided. Analysis of the changes in all three aridity measures indicates that by the end of the 21st century the Mediterranean region might experience a substantial increase in the northward extension of dry and arid lands, particularly in the central and southern portions of the Iberian, Italian, Hellenic and Turkish peninsulas and in areas of southeastern Europe (e.g. Romania and Bulgaria), the Middle East, northern Africa and major Islands (Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily). Most Ice-Cap areas of the Alps are also projected to disappear. These effects are due to a large warming and pronounced decrease in precipitation, especially during the spring and summer seasons. In addition, fine scale topography and coastline features affect the aridity change signal. We identify the southern Mediterranean as a region particularly vulnerable to water stress and desertification processes under climate change conditions.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in technology permit the irrigation of dry, coastal areas, avoiding the use of fossil water and conflicts with other land use (e.g., for food production). Consequently, it becomes reasonable to consider large-scale plantations for mitigating increases in atmospheric concentrations by carbon sequestration and to study local modifications of weather and climate. This work investigates the impact of plantations in Oman and the Sonora Desert in Mexico assuming an area of about 100 km × 100 km. For this purpose, an advanced land surface–atmosphere model was adapted to the local changes of land cover and operated on the convection-permitting scale. Explicit simulations of the impact of the plantation on soil–vegetation–atmosphere feedback were performed for a duration of 1 yr. A strong modification of diurnal cycles of variables such as surface fluxes, temperature, and boundary layer depth was found. Over the plantations, the mean temperature decreased as a result of nonlinear changes of the diurnal cycle caused by less warming during the day than cooling during the night. Moreover, the plantations caused an increase in vertical instability and a modification of the horizontal flow leading to the development of convergence zones. During several isolated cases in summer, this process led to convection initiation and precipitation with an enhancement of about 30 mm in both areas, respectively. These convection-permitting simulations lend confidence that an increase in precipitation could be induced at the mesoscale by the introduction of vegetation in desert regions. Furthermore, this effect should be included in a quantitative assessment of climate engineering by afforestation.},

Forest loss affects climate not just because of the impacts it has on the carbon cycle, but also because of how it affects the fluxes of energy and water between the land and the atmosphere. Evaluating global impact is complicated because deforestation can produce different results in different climate zones, making it hard to determine large-scale trends rather than more local ones. Alkama and Cescatti conducted a global assessment of the biophysical effects of forest cover change. Forest loss amplifies diurnal temperature variations, increases mean and maximum air temperatures, and causes a significant amount of warming when compared to CO2 emission from land-use change.
Science, this issue p. 600
Changes in forest cover affect the local climate by modulating the land-atmosphere fluxes of energy and water. The magnitude of this biophysical effect is still debated in the scientific community and currently ignored in climate treaties. Here we present an observation-driven assessment of the climate impacts of recent forest losses and gains, based on Earth observations of global forest cover and land surface temperatures. Our results show that forest losses amplify the diurnal temperature variation and increase the mean and maximum air temperature, with the largest signal in arid zones, followed by temperate, tropical, and boreal zones. In the decade 2003–2012, variations of forest cover generated a mean biophysical warming on land corresponding to about 18\% of the global biogeochemical signal due to CO2 emission from land-use change.
The biophysical effects of recent global forest cover change have caused measurable warming.

	abstract = {A two-source model developed to use radiometric temperature observations for predicting component surface energy fluxes from soil and vegetation was evaluated with data from a row crop (cotton). The total or combined heat fluxes from the soil and vegetation agreed to within 20\% of the observed values, on average. Component heat flux predictions from the soil and vegetation indicated that soil evaporation was generally higher than canopy transpiration. This result contradicts an earlier study which showed that soil evaporation was ∼1/3 of canopy transpiration rates with a significant source of sensible heat from the soil being advected to the canopy (Kustas, 1990). Moreover, the modeled derived canopy temperatures were ∼6 K higher and soil temperatures were ∼4 K lower than the radiometric temperature observations. In order to obtain more physically realistic soil and vegetation component heat fluxes and better agreement between the predicted and observed soil and canopy temperatures, two model parameterizations required modification. One adjustment was to the magnitude of the Priestley–Taylor coefficient αPT used in estimating canopy transpiration. The magnitude of αPT was increased by ≈50\% from its `universal constant' αPT ∼ 1.3 to αPT ∼ 2. The other modification was to the free convective velocity, UCV, defined as constant in the original formulation for estimating soil resistance to sensible heat flux transfer, RS. The new formulation is based on the recent experimental results from Kondo and Ishida (1997)who found that UCV ∝ ΔT1/3 where ΔT is the surface–air temperature difference. Both of these modifications are shown to be supported by observations from the literature and therefore are not considered merely model `tuning'. Furthermore, component heat fluxes predicted by the model using canopy and soil radiometric temperature observations support the higher αPT value and new free convective formulation for estimating RS. Two other changes to model algorithms are described which are relevant to all dual-source modeling schemes. One is replacing the commonly used Beer's law type expression for estimating the divergence of net radiation in partial canopy covered surfaces with a more physically-based algorithm. The other is a simple method to address the effects of clumped vegetation (common in row crops and sparse canopies) on radiation divergence and wind speed inside the canopy layer.},

	abstract = {Drylands occupy 6.15 billion hectares (Bha) or 47.2\% of the world’s land area. Of this, 3.5 to 4.0 Bha (57\%–65\%) are either desertified or prone to desertification. Despite the low soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, total SOC pool of soils of the drylands is 241 Pg (1 Pg = petagram = 1015 g = 1 billion metric ton) or 15.5\% of the world’s total of 1550 Pg to 1-meter depth. Desertification has caused historic C loss of 20 to 30 Pg. Assuming that two-thirds of the historic loss can be resequestered, the total potential of SOC sequestration is 12 to 20 Pg C over a 50-year period. Land use and management practices to sequester SOC include afforestation with appropriate species, soil management on cropland, pasture management on grazing land, and restoration of degraded soils and ecosystems through afforestation and conversion to other restorative land uses. Tree species suitable for afforestation in dryland ecosystems include Mesquite, Acacia, Neem and others. Recommended soil management practices include application of biosolids (e.g., manure, sludge), which enhance activity of soil macrofauna (e.g., termites), use of vegetative mulches, water harvesting, and judicious irrigation systems. Recommended practices of managing grazing lands include controlled grazing at an optimal stocking rate, fire management, and growing improved species. The estimated potential of SOC sequestration is about 1 Pg C/y for the world and 50 Tg C/y for the U.S. This potential of dryland soils is relevant to both the Kyoto Protocol under UNFCCC and the U.S. Farm Bill 2002.},

	abstract = {Photoinhibition in leaves in response to high and/or excess light, consisting of a decrease in photosynthesis and/or photosynthetic efficiency, is frequently equated to photodamage and often invoked as being responsible for decreased plant growth and productivity. However, a review of the literature reveals that photoinhibited leaves characterized for foliar carbohydrate levels were invariably found to possess high levels of sugars and starch. We propose that photoinhibition should be placed in the context of whole-plant source–sink regulation of photosynthesis. Photoinhibition may represent downregulation of the photosynthetic apparatus in response to excess light when (1) more sugar is produced in leaves than can be utilized by the rest of the plant and/or (2) more light energy is harvested than can be utilized by the chloroplast for the fixation of carbon dioxide into sugars.},

	abstract = {High-temperature tolerance in plants is important in a warming world, with extreme heat waves predicted to increase in frequency and duration, potentially leading to lethal heating of leaves. Global patterns of high-temperature tolerance are documented in animals, but generally not in plants, limiting our ability to assess risks associated with climate warming. To assess whether there are global patterns in high-temperature tolerance of leaf metabolism, we quantified Tcrit (high temperature where minimal chlorophyll a fluorescence rises rapidly and thus photosystem II is disrupted) and Tmax (temperature where leaf respiration in darkness is maximal, beyond which respiratory function rapidly declines) in upper canopy leaves of 218 plant species spanning seven biomes. Mean site-based Tcrit values ranged from 41.5 °C in the Alaskan arctic to 50.8 °C in lowland tropical rainforests of Peruvian Amazon. For Tmax, the equivalent values were 51.0 and 60.6 °C in the Arctic and Amazon, respectively. Tcrit and Tmax followed similar biogeographic patterns, increasing linearly (˜8 °C) from polar to equatorial regions. Such increases in high-temperature tolerance are much less than expected based on the 20 °C span in high-temperature extremes across the globe. Moreover, with only modest high-temperature tolerance despite high summer temperature extremes, species in mid-latitude ({\textasciitilde}20–50°) regions have the narrowest thermal safety margins in upper canopy leaves; these regions are at the greatest risk of damage due to extreme heat-wave events, especially under conditions when leaf temperatures are further elevated by a lack of transpirational cooling. Using predicted heat-wave events for 2050 and accounting for possible thermal acclimation of Tcrit and Tmax, we also found that these safety margins could shrink in a warmer world, as rising temperatures are likely to exceed thermal tolerance limits. Thus, increasing numbers of species in many biomes may be at risk as heat-wave events become more severe with climate change.},
